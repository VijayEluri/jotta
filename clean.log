 I forgot what username I regsitered on the free webhosting so I can't recover my acc because it goes by username ;_;
 what can I do?
 do you know the email?
 yeah
 type /msg outlet <email here>
 because I thought I hadn't registered, tried to register an account and it said my email has already been used
 and that sends username etc. to my email?
 no ill look it up
 ur username is "Pie"
 Ah.
 lol
 rob you havent happened to have started phpsteve?
 if this hasn't been done already, you might want to ban the account 'youcanplay'
 Saw wasn't really worth it, although i couldn't leave without going on it.
 Was a good day though concidering only cost me £7
 Pie`: why?
 And on what domain?
 Account info has been shared on a 'hacking site'
 http://www.zymic.com

 Jack, that's up to you I suppose
 Def up to you
 Doesn't appear to be legit, nevermind Andrew.
 Yea it doesn't, I just tried also
 Was just going to change password to something random
 Just send a email to the person telling them
 http://www.google.co.uk/search?rlz=1C1GGLS_en-GBGB311GB311&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=399,999,999,999,999+-+399,999,999,999,998
 google fail
 Sad...
 I see why that works, o at least probably
 because of integer limit, the largest value an integer can be in a computer is 2.147bn (And some extra digits in the middle)
 it works with any number of the 1 i gave you
 - 400,000,000,000,000 doesn't work either :P
 also http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&q=333333333333335+-+333333333333334&btnG=Search
 because of integer limit, the largest value an integer can be in a computer is 2.147bn (And some extra digits in the middle)
 ....
 lol
 wtf does 2.147bn mean
 don't tell me bn = billion
 Because that's the only thing that comes to mind
 And it's not in a computer, it's only certain programming languages that have these limits (or even just the variable type being used depneding on the language) that is limiting this.
 whatever :P
 but thats the onyl reason I can think off
 of*
 But i am wrong :(

 Apparently, Calculators like Google Calc use floating point arithmetic to handle these calculations. In the case of Google Calc they're using double precision floating point arithmetic

 look properly*
 brandon: those bikes on the pic are form the police :P we have police on bikes here XD
 from* typo
 Dolleh
 ruben
 a friend of mine got pulled over and fined
 with his car
 by a police officer on a bike
 We have motorbike officers, and officers riding horses
 i told him to just speed away is what i would do tehre is no way they could catch up
 I don't see them on push bikes though
 lol
 But then, you're better suited for bikes
 Proper cycle lanes everywhere
 we got police: in cars, motors, horses, bikes, skates even, and even quads :\  
 I think we do have quad bikes in the police force
 heh, the horses are useless, my dad was in London and this police woman on a horse was chasing some guy and the guy jumped over the railing... the horse couldn't follow without going all the way around. My dad being the good Samaritan pinned the guy though until the police woman arrived, but yeah, not exactly a great mode of transport. :-p
 For chasing people offroad I think :p
 We have bikes as wekk
 lol XD
 we have cops on quad bikes
 :D
 US have police on segways?!
 i want a segway

 Bread will kick your arse btw
 Crap, Jack isn't here! :(
 Nope
 'Sup Juw?
 damn you taxman
 i have to pay up 2k
 My birthday is in one hour Brandon!
 So is Jack's :)
 :O
 (on my timezone)
 :/
 `time Juw
 Time for Juw is: Sat May 02 22:45:50 2009
 :p
 1 hour and 15 minutes, aight
 "aight" ?
 Jacks is just a litte long than that :p
 your not northern
 (UK ofc)
 you can't say aight..
 Yes I can Pie`
 Lies..
 I just did, right? :)
 anyways, Joyeux anniversaire, Juw.
 !english Pie`
 Pie` any reason for the '`' ?
 None at all, Brandon.
 Juw: Happy birthday in french
 Brandon, they always do that on my website and competitors.
 I know Pie`
 Zymic is full of brits <3 :p
 Well, IRC nothing else haha
 :o
 pfft, juw aint alone
 Many tea drinkers :o
 juw, ik ga je pas feliciteren over een uur XD
 tea is awesome..
 tea FTW!
 see, even the duthc people drink it Juw!
 Coffee gtw.
 ftw*
 I don't like coffee, too bitter...
 Pie`, ofc, I drink tea too
 Just not that much as you brits :)
 juw, would you liek some tea for your b-day then? :D
 Well, I drink a lot on my job though
 like*
 Wow, youtube supports 1080p HD.
 They have very nice free tea :O
 even though ti says it doesnt :D
 Pie`
 it's not 1080p
 Nah Dolleh, I want money :)
 okay!
 For my "King's SR fund"
 Ruben, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylii55gPTbo&fmt=22
 1080p, I uploaded it myself.
 how much? million or 2? or 5 maybe?
 Pie`
 youtube encodes to 20fps
 and <1mbit bitrate
 50 would do fine, so I can buy a set of angel eyes for my Aprilia SR  :)
 1080p is ALWAYS 25fps
 according to the standards
 50,00 
 I think it would be more than 20, as the human eye can see upto 24 fps so we woul see it a bit jittery
 not mil
 if you want true 1080p hd
 try vimeo
 if you have a plus account there
 it will two-pass encode
 it would only be true if I was streaming the video through HD output ;)
 which gives like 40% better quality at same bitrate
 ahw looks pretty pie!!
 VGa/DVI != HD
 dvi is digital
 still not hi-def
 same signal as hdmi therefore you can buy those interchange things
 it sure is
 but right now I couldn't see it in proper 1080p, because the video output on ym graphics card is DVI(and a VGA) which I plugged into my tv's VGA port
 so a DVI -> VGA signal wouldn't show as full 1080p, and also my tv only supports upto 1080i ;)
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Visual_Interface#Specifications
 read about resolutions thnings there
 dvi is VERY suited for hd
 except for the fact it doesn't transmit audio
 which is why newer ati cards have hdmi out WITH audio
 my motherboard has HDMI out :p
 well
 i doubt you'd want your cpu to decode 1080p video
 sure, it can but that's what graphics cards are for
 Mozilla/4.0 (PSP (PlayStation Portable); 2.00)

 TheOracle its true, ask Alex
 @ Banjo
 Lies rebel.
 ^ doin it again
 Pfft
 Alex, ain't it no more than a hoax?
 I mean, I've never heard of bouncewith.me.uk
 Plus, I copied the News ID over to the BBC and got a 404
 http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/europe/8027043.htm
 TheOracle: it's because it is fake
 http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8027043.stm
 that's the real article, nothing to do with zombies
 Yes, I knew that, was tring to explain to banjo its a hoax :P
 :O
 and another fact is they link to Similar to a scare originally found in Cambodia back in 2005,
 but they use archive.org
 I didn't even open the page.
 http://web.archive.org/web/20050428004220/http://65.127.124.62/south_asia/4483241.stm.htm

 :/
 Keep that to yourself love, dronix may get some ideas ;)
 xD
 Hurts to breath this morning
 cant turn my neck either
 I'd imagaing it does :p
 http://www.mawaly.com/file/play/10930.html
 Can someone help me
 is it about hosting, Jordan ?
 Well yes
 shall i join hosting
 then join #hosting
 hi i am having problems logging into PHPMyAdmin
 #hosting
 thats odd
 Rebel you there
 hello
 hello anyone there?
 Jack, want this for another free template http://crownstyles.com/port/GeekSite/ ? .. Not sure if its worth me calling it a template xD
 Brandon, that could be a great template, just needs a background really
 possible some other stuff
 possibly*
 Yea, much more is needed but I can't be asked with it :p
 Lol :)
 I've been working on a site for a while now
 Started off really well but I just got more and mroe bored of it :|
 Was going to eb some kind of elaborate pastebin, with a community etc. built into it
 I'm not sure if I already sent this to J@ck http://crownstyles.com/port/cc/ but probaly have :p
 eb ?
 users "suggest" scripts and admins alow them to be passed if they're good enough
 be *
 Oh yea :p
 Doesn't sound like a pastebin then, sounds more like a resources site
 I guess so.
 The drag in that would be moderation
 A sizable script, you can only really check so much of the code quality
 And make an estimation of the rest
 Because, well, code audit is not something you do for free :p
 was only a project anyway
 wasn't going to be anhting huge
 anything*
 I quite like the idea, it just needed something to make that stage workable at scale
 Oh and also, whena  script is posted it acctually creates the file :D
 writes it to a "secret" directory
 Aye, below the document root
 Then you can serve it back with force-download
 mhmm
 and I only allow downloads when the download button is pressed
 Limiting to a single file has sort of killed the idea for me though :p
 so you can't link directly to it
 http://www.valuemyweb.com/value_report/30007-reporta81bd8c135d4b8f4a58b6c1890f3ca86 < Is it really worth that? ;o
 it says google is worth $29bn
 O_o
 :p
 (h)
 how come urlencode('test'); does nothing?
 rui
 Because there's nothing to encode there?
 "test" in a URL is "test"
 I must have mis-understood what urlencode does :D
 how many people oO
 a little question. on free hosting i can't off safemode, right?
 [14:36:04] <@Pie`> !bin2hex test

 Mine went when Adam made me drop my nick :(
 Made you?

 Well no make me, but told me how to group nicks wrong.
 Ah, you did it the wrong way around
 Yep.
 He said he was sure it was the right way.
 lol of cours he was
 yea pretty sure adam was the one who made me lose my nick and all my channels
 lame
 adam hates everyone
 Lol he was Andrew, I remember both of you dropped your nicks.
 I lost all my channels too and all my ops and stuff
 it was annoying
 heard of /ns help?

 ^
 You were here before me

 hey
 zup
 hey
 :(
 Sometimes I hate apple
 Really?  I thought you'd gotten to the point where that had become physically impossible :p
 I mean, you've started liking obj-c, how much worse can it be ;)
 They revoked my distrobution cert without telling me
 so now I have to manually revoke all my other certs
 then make them all again
 :@
 If they removed yours, then would they not just do it again?
 they removed everyone with access to beta 4
 each time a new beta is given to us
 are certs are null and void
 Heh, sounds like a fun incentive to be part of the beta programme
 *sigh* back again
 Alex the dev portal is awful
 Hi Dolleh
 hey timmie :D
 and how did it went with eating?
 This is just a registry file which inserts a valid key + registrant name into your registry under windows, this will only work if you already have mirc installed :)
 oops
 I managed chicken and pastah Dolleh
 Garlic bread was too tough
 :(
 I don't like Garlic bread anyway
 well great to hear you could manage chicken and pasta already :D
 well garlic bread, maybe you better waith with that, that def hurts <_>
 Nickalerts.com :-p -- Silly wheat based food.
 Heya Dolleh, sorry about earlier, I lost signal.

 Why thank you.

 BANJO!!! YUR FAULT!!
 :(
 haha I've finished this http://www.2flashgames.com/fullscreen.php?id=2290
 i cant get passed the bathroom
 haha its a piss easy game
 Bread: it is unfortunate that you picked an actual word as a handle really :p
 And you can't really switch back to an actual name, because.. "ed" turns up quite a lot too, and some clients do like to nick alert on partial word matches
 Ed, Edd, and Eddy
 We shall see ;-)
 Bred
 Nope, no nick alert
 That's alright then, that could work
 !voice
 Toast left :-p
 Toast is gone.
 Lol
 EdwardCradockAKABread Would be extra safe ;)
 Did not work :D
 I'll pass on that one Alex ;-)
 I think "and" would be a good nick name :D
 thats why you need something unique, like water
 :D
 Hello and
 Most words in the English language turn up eventually if you wait long enough
 hmm
 Banjo hasn't :D
 I went to the zoo and then I did this and then I did that and I hate jelly and ice cream and pickles

 hippy on a bus, sees a nun and goes over to her, he asks her to have sex. the nun replies that she's married to god and gets off the bus. the bus drive sas if you want to have sex with her go to the graveyard every night at 12, but dress up as god. hippy goes to the graveyard that night dressed as god, sees the nun and says "i'm god, i want sex", nun says ok, but asks for anal as she wants to keep her virginity, so they go ahead and when they finish, th
 and when ever someone does a refund
 My phone can go into the toilet and still function
 e hippy says "ahaa im the hippy".. the nun replies "ahaa im the bus driver"
 you have to refund 100% of the paid amount
 while apple still gets their commision fee
 (which is non-refundable)
 so you lose money when ever someone wants a refund
 No ruben I mean custom as in developed and distrobuted using adhoc certificates

 TWO of those
 and they were huge
 yes their very HUGE indeed o_0
 liek you couldn't bite into them
 properly anyway
 yes indeed XD
 (i could do it)
 that's not healthy
 :O
 (i have a very big mouth)
 really..^
 (i eat lots)
 how do they make them Ruben?
 i.e. did you see them making them ?
 I have a big mouth as well, but no way I can do that o_0
 yes
 cant* *cough*
 grilled ?
 rebel they have huge pieces of meat hanging there
 grilling while you're there
 and they cut off the slices in front of you
 ah IC
 on coal ?
 cut the salads in front of you
 i don't remember
 it's all done very well
 yes, coal
 not at all in a fastfood kind of way
 but it's fast took him like less than 2 minutes to prepare
 i went back for a second
 it's not supposed to be fast food
 last friday we went for a picnic and grilled kebabs and all kinds of stuff
 nice :D
 I bet our kebabs are much tastier that yours
 defenitly..
 you could have invited us :(
 next time I will, but you have to come
 :D
 it's Turkish btw
 yus, me knows
 rebel
 it originates from israel
 to be exact
 since crashing my eyes are yet to change colour
 they normally change with the time of day / light levels
 then migrated to Syria, then to lebanon palestne and Jordan
 Been stuck on dark grey for two days now :(
 Ruben: HELL NO!
 o_0 damn tim
 Ruben: unless you mean Palestine, but still not true
 Normaly they will change to a dark blue or green/brown through the day
 brb
 my eyes are gray with brown which
 sometimes makes people think they're red when the sun is shining into them
 one time
 a priest or what ever said i was possessed by the devil at the hotdog stand
 :D!
 XD lolk
 lol*
 mine are just... boring :(
 in the winter dark dark dark brown, near black
 in summer ligth brown
 thats all :\ 
 BORING
 back
 wb
 that's not boring
 mine glow in the dark
 I have the darkest brown eyes ever
 My eyes have over active melanin
 I KNEW dronix was from mars!!!
 the pigmentation thing
 Tim you'll alwasy sick
 dronix
 its not an illness
 its just genes fool
 xD
 oh, ok, then I guess it cool
 melanin is pigmentation
 so when over active they can change colour quickly
 within a few hours of light in my case
 other than that I am boring
 nothing else special about my body
 I like dark brown eyes, but not to have, cause everything around my face is brown already :\  
 mine still glow in the dark
 maybe I should dye my hair red! WOOT! \

 Brandon people dont know how I make money ;)
 dronix: slut :p
 Tim :p
 lol wtf

 This will be fun
 I will get asked a million questions about iphone shit now :(
 uff :(
 thats wh its soo annoying moose
 Tell him you're bi. :p
 I think you like the attention Tim, why r you making such a big deal, just tell'em its none of their business
 dronix: HAHAH
 Mr know it all now ;)
 Dronix you are a fool
 lol wtf 
 lol
 That doesn't work
 And why are you set to away :s
 Alex, me? :p
 The more you tell people to leave you along the more inclined they are to ask Droniz
 Dronix*
 No, telling people it's none of their business
 cus I'm going to work in 10 m
 :)
 I've been telling people I don't use Windows for ages, has done absolutely nothing to stop more questions about Windows crap
 Normaly its easy to work online I have a million usernames and my real name is common
 I get that from Banjo always asking about linux!
 Well, not so much now.
 I haven't used Windows for ages*
 didnt help getting mentioned on a tech site though that got people at school to my personal site :/
 then you get people asking about what I use it for ect
 I'd rather keep the two seperate
 When I go do this talk in London I won't be telling people its on founding startups ect I will say I am going shopping
 Haha
 my schools website is soooo poor
 same here
 it looks like a grenade hit it
 Though, it does help that I now charge by the call-out in pints from people I know
 But I dont want to be known ad the person to ask to do it Rico
 I expected that to slow things down, but all it's done is get me more pints
 Win-win situation
 not as bad as mine
 i have no choice but to do it over
 Alex I charge money instead
 Works much better
 slows things down and you can buy pints and have some left over
 [21:28:43] <Rico> my schools website is soooo poor
 No such thing as mates rates here I'm affraid
 my school ahs poor security
 I asked my art teacher for hes password, she gave me it
 I thought about that, but decided it was too much of a git's way out ;)
 now i have access to everything I could ever need
 http://www.foundationosa.org/SCHOOL.HTM lol plz dont laugh
 I can take my name off detention registers, Mark myself in for school, I've got the school wireless key
 Good for you, you are aware if you use that access it's still illegal
 http://www.kesgrave.suffolk.sch.uk/
 CACK
 lmfao wow.
 Rico wins :"
 http://www.magdalen.northants.sch.uk/cms/
 my site
 schools*
 lol
 I saw frames and quit
 and if u want some lulz
 https://home.mcsbrackley.co.uk/
 user: tammyf pass: ruby2000
 the funny thing is the icon templates the used on my schools site
 http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/ that's mine ;)
 are iphone templates made by a close online chum of mine xD
 your site is great compared to my schools
 but Rico, did your school do their own site, or did they pay
 So, Alex how're you ?
 My school is made by a teacher
 Not bad, you?
 i'm not gona show off my school :\ 
 it was a free job
 cause its fugly V_V
 Good, I'm just fine thanks :)
 They're going to have to pay soon in the UK
 http://www.pixelhorizon.co.uk/   <-- did my schools template
 Who want to make me and op in #zymic. I mean I was in a car crash.... ALEX :D
 Ermm
 It's going to be a requirement soon that all schools have a website which allows parents & pupils access to resources, results, etc
 Who wants to make me OPER on irc.zymic.com kai? I broke a finger nail :(
 No brandon
 I've read the stuff they sent out to the schools about it
 ADAM SUCKS
 Well no
 I love him really
 ... Coming from the bi.
 xD sorry timmeh :p
 But eww I have to be hop with Crown
 :O
 who wants to give me VOICE!!
 near 5 years of service and no op
 yeah
 Service?
 Haha
 Lol
 sitting here being a fool :D
 Tbh we have many ops and few ops
 and now tom is gone
 My name is close
 Alex: if you have the choice to be study computer science, computer engineering, graphic design, psychiatry, architecture  ... what would you choose ?
 if i disconnect my voice will be taken away??
 and I have the same BDay, you know it makes Sense Alex
 :)
 Rico, are you black?
 So does Jack
 Um... given I'm doing Software Engineering, what do you think, rebel? :p
 But he hates me for being a tractor boy
 lol yea pie`
 architecture
 I know Alex, but what if you have the chance to rechoose from the things I said
 I do still have a choice, I could switch, but I'm not
 mmmmmmmm
 whay ?
 why * ?
 Because I don't want to do the others?  They're quite different apart from Computer Science
 And I just already know I'm not interested in hardware, thus, the CSSE pathway which drops all the hardware from year three
 I mean, what makes you choose computer science? like what
 like what's interesting about it *
 O CRAP
 more than the others
 brb I gotta play the perfect daughter
 Technology is interesting, I derive a lot of satisfaction from completing projects, improving a solution I already have, or solving a specific problem.  I want to get into Software Engineering because it balances that part of it against some of the more people-oriented aspects
 And its more employable ;)
 is it ?
 any one know how do releive chest pain
 This is killing me
 I thought graphic design is
 Since you likely end up managing projects, but not as a clueless manager type, you still get to do actual thinking ;)
 Oh Alex I meant to ask! How's the job prospect at that place your dad is connected to?
 Any luck yet?
 I'm asking because after 1 year I'll have to make this decision, and I'm really confused, I like programing I like designing, I'm interested in psychiatry......
 He forgot to ask the last time he spoke to people there >_>
 Ouch
 Haha write him postits
 put the everywhere
 Hard to do from York, Tim :p
 Look where Daniel is going: http://wheresdaniel.info/wiki/index.php/Main_Page
 :(
 what ???
 rebel: I'd certainly be employable :p
 so when do i get permanent voice??
 I'm getting a degree from one of the best Computer Science departments in the country.
 And then Alex will work for me at YummyCocoa
 on a massive sallery
 :)
 2k per anum sound okay ?
 It'd have to be to deal with obj-c :p
 Haha, nah
 Haha
 No it would be around 50k before tax
 Alex: software engineering is different that computer science right ?
 Gah linkinus fails
 brb
 :O
 In some places it's a completely different course
 For me, it's not that different, you could get a similar course taking vanilla computer science and picking modules
 :O I just got a kernal warning
 Hmm
 I just prefer opting in and having my degree say "Computer Science and Software Engineering"
 not quite a panic but somthing is up
 Alex what would genrally lead to a panic?
 Could it be a major mem leak?
 Any fatal error, Tim
 Mine turn Alex <3
 Hi guys
 Is anybody here?
 yes
 I really need help installing my "mybb" forum
 http://www.voltagecommunity.co.cc
 that is my website and i get an error when I try to install it... http://www.voltagecommunity.co.cc/forum/install/index.php
 can you tell me the error ?
 yes
 Error  There seems to be one or more errors with the database configuration information that you supplied:      * Could not connect to the database server at 'localhost' with the supplied username and password. Are you sure the hostname and user details are correct?  Once the above are corrected, continue with the installation.
 your database details are wrong
 if you join #hosting they can help you out
 :)
 i recreated a new one
 let me check if it works
 It not work!
 it problem with zymic
 are you using the right username ?
 yes
 There is a limitation on username length
 I used
 How long is the one you're trying to use?
 database name: voltagecommunity_n1
 User name: voltagecommunity_n2
 Pass: *****
 so.. what to do :( ?
 The limit is 16 characters, which is unfortunately the length of your username
 If you make an account with a shorter username, and make a database there, that should work
 ahh
 Ok Alex
 Thank you very much bro

 the younger they are the tighter they are around your d***
 Bahaha

 timmie! :D
 how did xray stuff go?
 It didnt
 fecking hostpital
 Im in tomorrow at 5:30
 pm
 Heh, nice
 The hospital near me is new, so they're usually not bad, my GP is an idiot though, I've had to go there a few times 'cuz he screwed up
 Oh dear, what did he scew up on?
 Things like taking blood for tests, and forgetting that one of the tests required fresh blood, so it was too old by the time they got it there.  This was back when they were looking for causes of my migraines.
 So, his next suggestion was that they'd take the blood and then give it to us, and we could drive to the hospital and give it to them... They needed it within 30 minutes of taking it, we went to the hospital and had them do it :p
 Hah, what was causing the mirgraines?
 They never worked out a reason
 :o
 Could be a tumor or something silly :p
 Nah, I had my brain scanned >_>
 :p
 That wasn't much fun
 Did you have to go in one of them big round things ?
 They fix your head in place, because you can't move, and so you lie there completely still for about half an hour
 While the person meant to be monitoring stuff goes off to have a fag or something
 Hahah, should of got up and messed around with the computer or something.
 Thing about those machines as well, they're bloody loud
 Doesn't help if you have a migraine, right? :p
 Well, yeah, but I didn't at the time, it was just annoying
 If I had had one at the time, I wouldn't have been there.  Wouldn't like to end up chucking up in the machine or something
 No that would not been nice
 be*
 tweet twwet + apple = garbage
 :O
 :S
 Dronix was there any point?
 gossip about apple buying twitter, haven't you heard?
 Thats all it is gossip
 I block certain things shwoing up though
 What would Apple want with a website that is only surviving on venture capital?
 'Garbage' is what I was more worried about *evils*
 Alex, No idea what you just said :p
 Alex I'm sure they see somthing in it.
 no idea either
 Maybe an addition to mobileMe
 Status' from the iPhone
 $700m is quite a sum
 Not for apple
 Brandon: it's not making profit, the only reason twitter has money because venture capital investers keep giving it to them :p
 Oh I see
 You have to remeber large corps find that not very much at all
 Especially when making tens of billions
 is because*
 I'm sure apple have a viable reason
 There is some history in bigger companies buying out websites like these, but their long-term aim is always profit.
 Yeah
 I mean most of the successful iphone apps are twitter apps
 so its making them money allready
 yeah I'm sure they have a profound reason
 They don't need to own twitter for that though
 to improve and promote the service will be benificial
 If apple bought twitter they would close it off I bet
 because they are assholes like that.
 lol wtf
 I don't see how it's a viable return on investment for them
 Make it so only apple users can use it
 windows fan boy is hating again
 Andrew they're will be a clause preventing that
 there*
 I am happy that google didn't get it
 Doubt it, Twitter doesn't care that much about users :p
 I'm kind of tired of google trying to own everything also
 WTH
 I hate that I use them for email, but I love the gmail interface
 I think I have dislocated my finger
 They've gone so far as to say your personal information is an asset of the company, and they are fine with selling it, and sharing it
 :|
 brb
 (actually they already do share it)
 Most companies have better privacy policies than that
 [19:54] <&Alex> Brandon: it's not making profit, the only reason twitter has money because venture capital investers keep giving it to them :p
 Youtube, facebook, etc
 Very silly isn't it
 All of these big sites lose hundreds of millions a year
 Well, Google are trying to monetise youtube
 Not sure they'll manage it
 I think hulu is beating youtube in that reward
 Well bandwidth prices in 5-10 years time will help
 I <3 hulu
 hulu*

 Hi all
 hello
 Only important calendar page ;) http://www.zymic.com/forum/index.php?act=calendar&cal_id=1&code=showday&y=2009&m=11&d=3
 This one is almost as important http://www.zymic.com/forum/index.php?act=calendar&cal_id=1&code=showday&y=2009&m=8&d=13
 I aint on it :D
 *proud*
 <Andrew> @urban Alex <Phot> [URBAN] Alex <Phot> [URBAN] noun.
 ?
 urban dictionary command on a bot.
 Yea, what the heck ;o
 I looked up your name and it said you're a noun.
 All names are proper nouns
 What was so interesting about that :p
 So damn true Andrew: http://grabup.crownstyles.com/98bc520d7c103b9ae865f98b481168f7.png :p
 most of us had cool responces.. you just got noun
 [URBAN] andrew
 [URBAN] Ultra cool, Usually hot or at least sort of cute. Awesome sense of style, music, and humor. Sexy, awesome kisser
 outlet wasn't defined
 Many lies listed there :p
 You didn't argue about the great kissing last night Brandon 
 I know
 Plus, I thought I told you to keep that to yourself? ;[
 <Andrew> Macs are for faggots
 waits to see all the flames come down on Andrew 
 from who
 none of the mac fags are here
 andrew = windwoz fan boy
 And?
 ?
 ??
 :O TIM ADAM WHERE ARE YOU
 being gay with their macs
 Andrew !!
 Go die slag. :p
 andrew is jealous
 Yea, I agree.
 In my opinion I can't justify overpaying for an OS on hardware I HAvE to buy from the OS manufacturer. Everything I can do on mac I can do on windows.
 You guys just have to have it LOOK pretty.
 have it your way
 keep missing out
 That's your only justification for using mac, "I don't want to miss out"
 I'm not missing out on anything by not having a mac
 if there was something on a mac that i REALLY wanted and couldn't get on windows/linux (Not likely)
 apple pie is with out apple is just a pie
 I'd just download a mac iso
 and run it on a vm
 And a house without windows is an insane asylum.
 No.
 I never said you HAD to buy a mac, I think running the os is more than enough, I too agree with not wanting to buy the hardware
 Yea, hardware side sucks =[

 When I can be bovered I'll upgrade my HDD & RAM :)
 Similar spec to my laptop, what'd it cost you?
 Alex, you don't want to know :(
 I will get osx and run in a virtual machine and see if it changes my opinion. If it does I'll apologize. It won't though.
 $2400 brandon?
 Mine cost £400 a year ago
 at least $2000
 ^
 Like, 4 times that Alex ;p
 thats the downside to macs, you can fully customize the hardware
 *can't
 So, what you're saying is
 OSX cost you about £1000 ;)
 On there site its like Â£80 :/
 I think
 lol.. that wasnt alex's point
 Yes, I know
 :P
 I was saying on there site its like Â£80 odd and like why am I paying this much for this crap :p
 Well, I didn't pay for it heh
 Yes, Â£83 :(
 you are better off making a hackintosh
 iirc I got a OSX DVD with mb though so I may try it on pc :p
 I think the reason they are so expensive is because of the design of the macs aswell as the boxes :p
 Other than the price I'm happy with it :p
 I would consider hackintosh my my mobo and processor aren't on the list
 I've yet to learn how to code going to be hard :p
 maybe i'll steal a neighbors computer lol
 Lol
 I'd call you a thief for doing so though
 You're the theif brandon
 You stole my heart
 I'm now tempted to go install on pc :p
 im gonna try it this summer
 Why summer? You've got awhile to go :p
 not really..
 im done school june 13
 12*
 How old are you?
 17
 lol I bet you are counting outlet
 yep..
 No way! you look 12 years old :p
 im not 12..
 he never said you were
 brandon
 he said you look it
 Your mac CD won't work on PX
 PC
 Wont it? :(
 huh?
 I'll see if it works.
 it does work
 Yea, Pie`is right
 no it shouldnt.. ususally requires some patch..
 no, http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=113288
 however thats not the recommended way of installing osx on a pc
 It "can" but only after a modification
 but you could buy whatever comes with a psystar openpc
 well this bootloader allows you to now
 but before it was you had to download a modified dvd
 yeah thats how I tried it on my laptop before getting the imac
 Wait, OSX only works on Intel?
 I think you can make it work on an amd, not sure, my lapop is an amd
 osx86project.org
 ive got an AMD 64
 :D
 thats where I got the guide from
 yeah intel
 Hmm, yea didn't boot up :(
 you need a patch Brandon
 Linkage son
 make sure you hardware is supported: http://wiki.osx86project.org/wiki/index.php/HCL_10.5.6#AMD
 insanelymac and osx86project.org is the same site
 brandon
 http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=113288
 This tells you how to do it
 without downloading the modded osx dvd
 You just need to get their bootloader and burn to a CD
 can't use amd though
 or u can installed the mac os
 then install GRUB
 ??
 might work :/
 GRUB supports everyhting
 even windows 7
 ;D
 Meh, I don't want to install on Intel PC to much work. Its packed down :p
 uuuq is down ?
 no Bread broke it
 but yes
 Where can I get a vhost?
 at the store
 ?!?!?1
 Pie`: You'd have to ask Bread or Alex.

 Bread or Alex how do I rename a file again within ssh?
 mv
 ty sir
 There is rename for renaming multiple files by regex though, but move is all I ever use.
 Heh, just needed it for one file in anycase.
 I really need to remember these.
 you will the more you use them.
 They're basically mnemonics so they shouldn't be too hard to guess.
 I know rm -rf deletes a dir, ls lists everything in dir, del deletes single files, reboot reboots server :p
 Yea
 I use rm for single files
 Like uptime :p
 rm: missing operand
 Heh, I don't even have a del command on mine.
 :p
 Yes, it's rm <file>
 rm does ?
 Ohh
 removes a file
 That's what rm -rf does, recursive forced
 Yea =]
 If you didn't have forced it would ask you if you were sure you wanted to delete the file :-p
 Yea
 I'm not sure how to restart like dns httpd etc.. via ssh though
 Most of those are in init scripts, so /etc/init.d/httpd restart, or sometimes /etc/init.d/apache restart, just explore your /etc/init.d/ directory
 Means logging into root but i cba :p
 Depends on the version of the software too, /etc/init.d/apache2 is what I have on my system.
 Oh really
 You know how to login as root from your shell account, yep?
 Nope?
 "su", I prefer to use "su -" though as it then gains the home directory of root, not the user that executed it.
 oic
 Bread: that's not the only difference
 su - gives you a proper new shell, whereas "su" leaves a lot of stuff from the previous user's session
 yeah, but those don't usually bother me :-p
 Stuff like: http://pastesite.com/6945
 Just for an easy example :p
 I get bash: /bin/su: Permission denied though :/
 you probably need to add yourself to the wheel group
 oic
 as root ls -al /bin | grep su, check the group
 Added
 The the password would be the root password?
 Then8
 *
 Oh
 I went on whm and added myself to it :p
 haha
 oops
 i ment hehe*
 you will need to log out and log back in Brandon for the group to take effect, but yep, that should be it.
 Yep
 But now, when I type just 'su' it asks for a password :p
 yep, that's the root password.
 Yea, I'm on
 I never knew that :p
 only problem is root password is 15chars long and you can't mem it :(
 Alex question for you :p .. How do I add a opper via OS ?
 Or do I have todo it manualy ?
 You have to do that manually, it's a server thing, not a services thing
 Sucks, but ohwell.
 Also, how do I get out of 'su' ?
 exit?
 Heh yea
 I seem to be talking to myself again, I don't enjoy it honestly :p
 poor brandon.. 
 outlet: notice me a password you'd like to use? :p
 did you get it?
 No
 Wait
 Had to be awkward didn't you :p
 :P
 i just put random letters together to fake word
 My dog ran away
 :(
 i saw :(
 Alex, cs_statusonadd what is the one like that for inspircd? I can't seem to find it :p
 i think alex is hiding from you
 just like bread hiding from me
 :O bread why isnt steve here..
 hes got a cron jobs to make him reconnect...\
 Why does he keep disconnecting?
 i dunno.. but its should reconnect.. when the cron job runs
 any one know when he died?
 /home/outlet/steve/cronjob/autostart.sh > /dev/null bread is that correct?
 i'm gona get tea, sorry I murdered steve secretly yesterday :( OOPS
 not me
 cause thats whats in the command box
 outlet: http://grabup.crownstyles.com/25ebffffb6f4d692fd6ccdb1bdfdcbdd.png
 hmm
 hes not connected to anything then..
 A bug you should fix :p
 yeh..
 bread any idea why?
 Brandon any place i can go to see that? 
 See what?
 whatever you screenshoted
 Ermm, not sure..
 alright i killed that process so lets see if he comes back
 ohhh i wonder if its when irc burps he gets d/c and tries to connect but cant?
 there he is.
 so the cronjob works
 :p
 He just doesn't die in proccess
 just something making his connection die.. and the cronjob only works if the proccess is dead
 so lets do this
 brandon would you mind seeing if his process is still active?
 Lol: http://grabup.crownstyles.com/00dd9306dcbdf77fd631e86397ccb3d9.png
 wuts -f do?
 Runs in the background me thinks, Bread?
 :(
 to run in background u can do
 nohup command /args/ & >> file.log
 will log all output to file.log :D
 bread / swordz how can i make steve check if hes been killed from the server..
 cause i just killed him from irc but his process is still goin?
 outlet, if(fread($sock, 128)) == NULL) { //connect } ?
 Oh I was wrong me thinks file.php & runs in bg :p
 well id rather just kill the script so it can be re ran its less likely to screw something up
 outlet, after the while loop put fclose($sock);
 that way if its not reading the script will stop :D
 you could also die() I guess too
 but fclose() will just send the script to the end so it will stop anywya
 okay so right after the while look put that?
 loop* yeah
 because the while loop will never end as long as the bot is connected
 how did you create your while loop?
 http://pastesite.com/6947/stevebot
 okay heres part of steve
 remove while(1) {
 you don't need that
 oh really?
 yeah
 set_time_limit(-1);
 if you stick that in the while loop the execution limit doesnt kick in :D
 where at the top?
 inside while($data ...
 any specific place?
 line 14
 http://pastesite.com/6948/stevebot9yTo
     while($data = fgets($socket, 256)) {
  <-- put set_time_limit(0); here
 alright.. lets head to #test
 once thats tehre you can get rid fo the while(1) loop
 I'm off, cya laters
 later brandon
 Does PHP execute stuff as it gets to it in the file, or would it go back if something chages to make a condition true/false ?
 is there a way to list processes i have running from shell bread?
 ps -ef
 holy crap
 o_0
 lot of processes running
 XD
 alright lets see what happens
 :confused:
 I really want to make a connect() function
 is there a way to list only processes ran under a specific user.. rather than all processes
 so i just can reconnect the bot on a certain action
 there he is :)
 outlet, probably, i just don't know
 now lets see if his process is running
 woohoo thanks Pie` it worked
 :p
 wooot

 sharan, All hosting related questions are to be directed towards #hosting ; to join the channel please type /join #hosting
 shouldnt there not be a space between #hosting and ; ?
 there is

 Pie`: there SHOULD be
 hm that broke
 Otherwise if people click it they will join #hosting;
 sec.
 !part #zymic
 Andrew, I've never seen a space between a word and a semicolon before
 Did you even read what I said?.......................
 Yes becase like he said it will make people join #hosting; if they click it.
 Hover your mouse over #hosting;
 yeah, you said thjere SHOULD be
 (except my irc client it ignores it)
 Yes, there should be....;
  Otherwise if people click it they will join #hosting;
 im saying there shouldnt be a space
 THERE SHOULD BE ADMIT YOUR WRONG!
 WE KNOW
 I'm not saying in real life, but in this damn instance there should be...
 Look basically if there isn't a space then people will join '#hosting;' not '#hosting'
 my client joins #hosting
 me shrugs
 So does mine but other peoples don't.
 Yea but you're not a mibbit user
 screw mibbit :p
 And xchat doesn't ignore the semicolon
 Go die.
 ^ +1
 thats not nice :{
 And you're being annoying
 I can't help the fact that some irc clients dont ignore a symbol which sint allowed in a registered channel name anyway...
 It is too allowed...
 [13:18:10] * Now talking on #hosting;
 if it was then how come mirc ignores it?
 /join #hosting;
 do it
 mIRC is stupid.
 our IRC server allows ; in chan names
 *shrug*
 ugh man, microsoft isn't letting me download windows 7 RC
 it keeps stopping randomly in the middle of the download
 I think it's because my internet is SHIT
 the downloader tool they made you use for build 7000 worked like P2P i think, could stop/start when you wanted
 i think..
 It does, but when it froze I tried pausing it so I could resume it (to try to kickstart it) but it just froze on "Stopping" and wouldn't change to "Stopped" to let me resume
 I left it for about 45 minutes
 I'm just gonna download from torrent
 At least there I can limit my download speed and not completely rape my internet for 12 hours
 My download speed sucks ass. I get about 130kb/s
 :O
 yea so I have uTorrent's scheduler setup, so that it limits my download to 40kb/s so it doesn't slow everything down and it automatically goes to max when everyone is sleeping and when people aren't here.
 hmm that sucks.
 that was odd
 :/
 need some pr0n :o
 I'd ask for link but not so sure anymore.

 Are global variables bad?
 i dont see why they would be
 $GLOBALS['varname'] :D
 Yeh i know but can't remember who said it, might of been Bread or Alex said use a class instead or something. Was just double checking before i use globals (not using php btw, coding c#)
 Are you using preset, or setting your own?
 ah
 probably should use a class instead then
 Making my own
 As they know lots of stuff better than me
 ahh gay :( just more effort lol. Ok i shall use a class then.
 Banjo: I was also told that global vars are bad in js
 I think that was it in the js channel

 how can I remove registred domains in zymic? I have the free ones uuuq.com

 Bread: you cook ?
 Bread is a cheif ;)
 Bread is a very good cook, i remember when he made burgers hmmm ;)
 I love cooking... or at least watching cooking shows
 Werido :p
 because Bread, otherwise people would be asking the question opposite to yours, "Why aren't knifes sharp, they never cut anything"
 thankx for help :)
 Not that bad, hurt like a bitch when I did it though

 A wise Chinese man said... YOU'RE LAME Banjo!
 :(
 XD
 I want to meet this wise Chinese man, he seems a little off
 seems to have Banjo and Bread mixed up ?? :confused:
 lol
 banjo went off, and bread just said goodnight :D
 :P
 my youtube lookup NEARLY works perfect D:
 it messes up though if www. or http:// are missing off the start of the url
 blergh D8 dishes, does the wise chinese man has something for that bread?
 oh nevermind :D
 Afraid not Dolleh. Destroy the  dishes, then there's nothing to wash  :)
 Bread, how many forum moderators does it take a change a light bulb?
 Go on?
 None, there is no light bulb. Thread closed
 :P
 im gona break some dishes then :D
 how many Irish people does it take to change the light bulp ?
 5; one standing on a chair holding the bulb, 4 rotating the chair
 Hah, that's a good one.
 how many Irish people does it take to wash a bus ?
 Mainly because of the imagery it conjures up
 go on?
 0 there is no bus
 100; 1 holding the thing you clean buses with
 like a toil 
 is it a toil ?
 what's a toil ?
 Lost me now
 anyway the other 99 shake the bus
 one person holds a towel 
 towel yes that's it
 you don't clean buses with a towel though
 hrm, you know the first one you said would be better if you said Jews
 how many Jews does it take to change a light bulb.
 none
 5 one to change the bulb and the other four to rotate the chair.
 makes more sense
 nope
 because of barmitzfas or however the hell and their weddings
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrQwymhUV6s&feature=related JEWISH CHAIR DANCE
 none, because someone else will do it for the,
 oops caps
 no
 anyway did you get the last one ?
 1 holding the towel, 99 moving the bus
 How many gay men does it take to change a lightbulb ? 
 Three. One to screw in an Art Deco bulb, and two to shriek, "Fabulous!"
 how many ?
 Deco means ?
 Art Deco is a type of ... umm decorating?
 like Antique
 oh ic
 How many men does it take to screw in a lightbulb ? 
 just u
 Only one. Men will screw anything
 so if an american find a bug in their coffee, what would he/she do ?
 I personally would pick it out
 I'd still drink the coffee, unless it was a roach. Roaches gross me out
 he'd throw the coffee away, what if a british man find a bug in their coffee
 ?
 I don't drink coffee
 LOL andrew that's exactly what I was going to say
 :P
 what if a chinese man finds it ?
 throw the coffee and eat the bug
 haha
 so wait british people don't like roach?
 he'll kick its ass
 a jew ?
 a jew will sell it on ebay
 no they will pick the bug out and drink the coffee 
 no he will sew the shop for being anti semitic, accuse palestinians and ask for $$$ from us 
 first one is @ andrew: so wait british people don't like roach?

 yea
 The BBC link is to an article about a stash of money in Baghdad
 http://safat.info/
 look at the site
 yeh I know
 I probed the email address, usually the first thing I do
 It looks like its an email host
 http://www.gawab.com/webfront/register.php?formAction=start&selDomain=safat.info
 Thats the register link
 i don't think its english either
 http://www.gawab.com/webfront/NewGawab/ar/ar.gif

 It's LCD though
 So at least it's crisp
 so's my 17"
 Better than my old CRT
 heh
 thing with this 22" tv im usin as a montir, is the text is just that little TINY bit furry around the edges
 its a bit noticable
 but its not noticably annoying
 Did you hook it up with svideo
 im usin dvi out from pc into vga
 ahh
 probably why?
 Andrew: same as mine, but not LCD, and with higher resolution..... gonna change it soon
 I have my 22" tv hooked up, but I had to use svideo to rca converter, it's HORRIBLY blurry
 haa.
 I wanna get 2x 22"
 then my screen res would be uh
 (1680x1050)^2

 Zymic abuse
 puya3d.com
 :/
 lol
 joshpelk: Join #hosting plese
 please
 I am on hostinmg
 hostinmg?
 lol ignore it frank :P
 what ever
 Hello
  i need speck administrador zymic site
 join #hosting valentin ;)
 is this an abuse report valentin?
 Anyone know what /me is raw?
 Has anyone ever used SiteFros.com?
 *Frost.com
 Nope
 :p
 what does zymic have currently?
 Yeah, well, I've had it on a list of things to do for a while now, but this IRCd works
 So I don't see the need, if we move hosting shell I probably would
 :p
 Frank: UnrealIRCd
 ok
 The thing is, I don't trust the unreal developers any more
 Why's that?
 Do you have to have that running all the time for irc to work?
 To keep working on it properly, they seem to be flitting around a load
 Frank: yes, of course :p
 Can use your computer if it's off :P
 Same with IRC daemon
 They spent ages working on an Unreal 4.x branch forking from InspIRCd
 Frank: you're going to create an irc netwrok?
 Then all of a sudden they decide nah, we'll drop that
 I wish I could
 I dont know how though
 But while that was going on the 3.x tree sort of stagnated, and a lot of old devs left
 I'm not sure any of the developers who know the current tree inside out are still there
 And now they dropped their planned next version, that's not going to be a viable move, so InspIRCd looks good
 How do you create your own irc network?
 Install an IRC server
 [14:16] Alex: So I don't see the need, if we move hosting shell I probably would <~ Don't see the need of what? Moving zIRC?
 that's a good start
 Need an IRC daemon too
 Changing the server TheOracle
 ic
 TheOracle: of switching this IRCd to InspIRCd from UnrealIRCd
 I dont know anything about irc
 Alex: Isn't InspIRCd the daemon Crown runs?
 Then it's probably best not to start one without reading up first :p
 TheOracle: by my recommendation, yes :p
 lol
 So what do I need to start one?
 <Alex> Then it's probably best not to start one without reading up first :p
 :/
 Well...
 :p
 Well, it's not a simple, install this
 Alot of crap to configure
 You may also want to read the RFC Frank
 To get an idea of how IRC works
 I guess I wont start one then
 it looks complicated
 For the best, IRCds that aren't looked after end up being host to botnet command & controls
 Banjo: I've switched from nettalk :O
 Does anyone know of a irc alternative?
 Using Miranda now
 Frank: Dunno
 Chatroom script?
 I want something just like IRC
 Well, good luck then
 lol
 just setup a channel on a well known IRC server
 Freenode, etc
 I dont know what irc server i should use?
 that's what alot of people do, it's easier because bigger irc networks have MANY servers
 freenode would be a start
 yea
 ok
 What is Freenode?
 irc.freenode.net :/
 What was everyone just talking about? IRC servers :P
 lol
 What server software do i need?
 Uh, what?
 What irc server sytem do i need?
 For your own server?
 yeah
 You'd need a IRCD (IRC Daemon)
 Alex: Unreal is easier to use than inspircd right?
 I personally don't find either complicated :p
 And I have to run that on my computer all the time?
 If you're going to get confused about one, you'll get confused by the other
 Brandon: Why would you ask Alex? He's thinks everything on the internet is easy :P
 Frank: running something like that on your own computer is not a good idea
 Then what do I run it on?
 If you want your own server, you'll want to shell out for an IRCd shell, or a VPS/dedicated server that allows IRC services
 frank
 $10/mo+ as a rough baseline
 We were saying just use irc.freenode.com to have a CHANNEL.
 NOt a whole server.
 ok
 Freenode isn't the best place to setup camp.
 Why not us zymic ?
 Yea, we have hops here. :O
 And voice
 and owner
 Freenode has fairly specific rules about what kind of stuff is allowed to set up channels there
 and +a :O
 It's a free software hangout
 And free projects related to that kind of thing
 Freenode has a system for different levels of staff per channel as well
 orly?
 Just, by policy they prefer that people don't op up except when needed
 So it's mostly transparent as far as the regular users are concerned
 brb
 Interesting exit
 im off for a bit
 Definitely Interesting :-p
 Later on Andrew 
 Not such an interesting Quit
 hello
 i need help plz
 Hosting related?
 yes plz
 join #hosting
 i forgot my web hosting password
 ok
 thank you
 Banjo
 I'm not using Nettalk anymore :O
 Trice: Did you sort out your daddy?
 you are an odd boy:P
 Heh :p
 Really?
 Yea
 :p no. I may do.
 Looking for a tunnel now though
 the world is gonna have to swap to IPv6 soon
 we're "running out" of IPv4 addresses
 Yes
 128 bit addresses waiii :p
 Hideous IP addresses to remember / write though
 2002:0:0:0:0:0:50b0:e6b7
 thats my ipv6 ip
 hey
 is there anybody how can explain me how to get into phpmyadmin?
 move to #hosting
 ok
 Bread: how often do you have to remember an IPv4 IP address off the top of your head? :p
 DNS ftw, and for those odd situations where you don't have that, a notebook will do :p
 :p
 Well not a lot, but if I DID need to ;-)... yeah, I have a hardback book I scribble in
 I might end up moving to a A4 size thing, but for the moment I like having the smaller thing, I can stick it in a pocket
 Anything that means I don't have to lug a backpack around :p
 Back
 Hi i am on the right place to look for help with my Zymic web account?
 join #hosting
 sorry i am new here how dfo i do this?
 Heh, I got given mine when I went to get a job at an antivirus company... waste of time, contract said I wouldn't get paid for the training if I didn't qualify etc... and that was like 4 weeks so I dropped out after first day, kept the book they gave me though ^_^
 Type /join #hosting helpme or click on the name
 helpme type /join #hosting
 hehe nice Bread :D
 Good habit to get into, making lots of notes.  Proper engineering practice
 I'm trying to make myself do it more :p
 My Dad has A4 books of notes going back 20 years or something
 Takes up half the wall of our office back home ;)
 Sure quite a lot of those aren't really relevant any more though
 Haha :p
 Well if it ever comes to it, you can burn them instead of books (The Day after Tomorrow
 HELP!!
 CAN ANYBODY HELP ME???
 I need somebody, not just anybody?
 Oh, apparently not
 Alex
 Are u an admin?
 Shame, thought we had a beatles fan for a second there
 WHO WORKS FOR UUUQ?
 I maintain the IRCd, I don't work with the hosting if that's what you're asking
 ClubDevin: we don't really need the all-caps, it's considered quite rude...
 ClubDevin: Join #hosting we will assist there.
 im sorry
 but i dont want to!
 can somebody just give me some help?
 <Banjo>ClubDevin: Join #hosting we will assist there.
 You were offered help just now, in #hosting
 Also don't just ask for help, we can't help unless we don't know the problem.
 -.-
 Um, Banjo, you mean unless we do know ;)
 Oh yeh my bad :(
 hehe
 nobody is in http://www.mibbit.com/chat/?server=irc.zymic.com&channel=%23zymic#
 type /join #hosting
 sorry
 Let me help out here
 ok well i cant see my site!
 Ok, you should be in #hosting now
 Ooh me thinks Alex used superadmin :O
 o.o
 hehe
 I need assistance please. :)
 If you need help with the hosting, then please join #hosting
 Otherwise ask away :)
 hmm wonder why people don't read the topic.
 I'm not sure which link is getting people here
 The forum has a big "HOSTING help" link above the #zymic one :p
 Yeh, well they might be getting the links from http://www.zymic.com/contact-us/ and http://www.zymic.com/irc/
 oh actually maybe not, there not mibbit links my bad
 It's probably the live chat one in the forum header
 Yep... this one.
 oh yeh
 outlet's creating a gateway page which we'll link them to
 Ah, was that what the zirc logo crap was about :p
 yep
 Nice, should be good :)
 To replace the current zymic.com/irc?
 zirc logo?
 Possibly, would have to check with Jack, but it'll replace the links in the forum for def.
 brandon you broke steve :(
 No?
 yeh.. you said "bye steve"
 Just out of interest who does the coding? http://www.zymic.com/layout-coding/
 No I didn't
 Me Banjo
 Ahh I see Brandon ;-)
 I'm secretly a professional coder :p
 BAHAHA
 *cough*
 Honestly :p
 hehe sure you are ;-)
 He still beats you BJ
 Lies
 Banjo > Brandon > Tim
 Pfft.
 Actualyl Tim you can't speak about coding you code in objective-c, right Alex? ;)
 you got your &gt; and at &lt; mixed up
 outlet: bring steve back then?
 I'm loath to decide which deserves my scorn more out of Obj-C/Cocoa and anything .NET :p
 Alex
 The only reason you dont like Obj-c is the syntax
 That's the only reasons I dislike Obj-c, yes
 Cocoa is another matter, closed platform
 reason*
 Alex: Why you not like .NET?
 Alex you just need to do a header dump and voila!
 The source is all yours haha
 Banjo: because it only really works on Windows
 and xbox
 the only thing i dont like about xbox is no web browser
 like on PS3
 i like c# its a bit like javascript in a way :D
 Tim, you could get the source sure
 But you can't actually use it except on Macs unless you go against the terms of the license on it
 Apple have no issues with you using the Private API's alex
 On Macs, they probably don't
 Well as Cocoa is a the OS programming API its seems odd that you would port it
 as its an interface for the AppKit framework
 Lies.
 Not all of it is platform dependent
 A fair bit of it extends obj-c in general terms
 And people have ported it to some extent already ;)
 Well there is a Java script port
 Objective-J
 It's just never going to have any real support on other platforms, which is why I won't be using it :p
 I think I mentioned it at some point
 Inasmuch as is feasible
 Qt is probably the best I've seen.
 I have yet to look at it

 Hmmm Pie``
 What kind of helm should I take tomorrow?
 A systemhelm, which can open like http://www.elsware.nl/media/MTR_black_open.jpg
 Or just integral http://www.fan.tv/motor/filecontent/images/IntegraalhelmNieuw.jpg
 i like the first one
 second one probably safer though
 They say systemhelms are safer though
 They usually have more protection inside
 Integral helms are usually more popular here in Holland :)
 around my neigbourhood I mostly see systemhelms :\  
 they anoyy me XD lol their EVERYWHERE GAH :\

 heheh I had like hallucinations last night lol
 oeh :O
 the valium was insane!
 I imagined being at the crash in the police car
 it all happening backwards
 I was txting keir one min
 then the next min my text was finished
 and all I could remeber was that little dream
 It happened a few times last night
 was odd
 I'll buy your job lot
 Branon you been speaking to andy :(
 .. Yes?
 http://i38.tinypic.com/2l8w3tu.jpg
 You whore.
 I am?
 whore whore whore
 You love it.
 duh
 banjo.... maybe they try to tell someone is a whore.. maybe...
 :O
 yes indeed
 anyone know how I can get internet explorer 6 on my computer
 windwos 7 comes with IE8 by default, and I need IE6 to test websites
 and browsershots is annoying.
 Andrew, I hope explorer destroyer gets passed :D
 means microsoft can't release anymore OS' with IE built in
 because apparently its a breach of user rights or somethihng
 psh, I have no issue with it but I think if they are going to release something built in they should REQUIRE it be upgraded after they are two releases behind
 I mean for god sakes people running IE6 should at the very least be upgraded to 7
 Tune right http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvWMLAWrEjU ?
 Alex, say you have 8cores yes. What would it be called? As you've got quadcore then ..
 Or someone ^ :p
 octcore I'd say
 octocore maybe even
 octo core yes. Apple does them :P
 If ya knew why'd you ask :P
 Well, I need to verify :p
 I'd call it a quaduo, sounds caller Xd
 Brandon, that song is pro
 I agree
 People who say MJ is a bad artist, are shitheads.
 hey Pie` if MS can't have IE included by default how am I supposed to download firefox when I install a fresh copy of windows?
 Have people thought about that?
 Andrew, part of the system
 no uninstalled
 because if you remove IE form windows it won't work
 because its an actual part
 Ahh
 okay, that still won't "really" change anything
 Just make it so you can un-install it :D
 It won't really change anything, and it will break a TON of applications
 I don't bother writing web pages for IE browsers, I just write "Best viewed in Firefox" in the footer
 Like for example, my html editor has a built in IE preview, and i'm positive that relies on the "built-in" ie
 Andrew, it won't break the applications they will just re-write the applications
 Andrew, it most likely uses the Mircosoft browser engine
 Pie`: You don't get that choice when your client uses internet explorer himself. And making websites for the masses you better have your site work in all browsers.
 In VB, you can create a browser in a few seconds, it's about 3 lines of code
 Lies.
 Depends what features you have in it
 Banjo, a window that will visit a webpage + display the page content, rather than the source
 and in vb it's internet explorers browser just inside your app.
 In visual studio 2008 theres a button that says "Create a browser" or something
 + I doubt it's IE inside your application, most likely the engine used for parsing html
 I'm nearly positive that instead of including the engine with your application it relies on the installed version since it is ALWAYS included with windows
 Pointless bulk in apps when windows comes with the engine
 Who would make a browser in vb anyway.
 Seriously....
 My friend did
 But I wouldn't use it XD
 Yes I made one in vb as well, but might as well use IE as its probably better.
 http://i41.tinypic.com/23hpruc.png
 Someone here has the authority as an administrator?
 or FF and Chrome as it is better.
 wow, my friend thinks he can turn that into a proper w3c compliant web page in 2 days
 Fixman: Me and Andrew do
 with no web programming experience
 Damn I could do that in an hour :P
 but Andrew, he has no programming experience at all
 of ANY kind
 in ANY language
 shit design anyway, he should throw it away
 :D
 Quote: "its not that hard to code a web design lol"
 Arg Andrew I don't think I can go back to vb lol, just opened it and started writing c# haha
 haha
 I'm not going to learn Qt for a while, I need to sit down and read a book on it. And finish my c++ tutorial I was going through before I even start reading about Qt
 Im going to get that C++ book Alex has
 Accelerated C++ I think it is.
 He, can someone tell me how i should stop the black background from going past the images? http://firechips.uuuq.com/test.html (CSS: http://firechips.uuuq.com/theme.css )
 hey*
 when making a web template Andrew, notepad or dreamweaver?
 notepad ftw
 neither I use RapidPHP
 I enjoy it's code highlighting and I love the built in PHP features it has
 Shit I use it to open txt documents even
 Andrew, jEdit.. :D
 I coded some vb in notepad :D
 Has an amazingly powerful search tool, lets you search with regex queries
 written fully in Java
 + has a package manager(<3)
 http://clients.crownstyles.com/ServerFactor/ I really don't know what else to do to this :P
 + code highlighing for shit loads of languages
 + a php tester, so it tests your scripts for errors as you write them
 and highlights starts/ends of braces
 () {} etc.
 AARGH :O BRB haffta get prices o_O WTH
 SEXY BRANDON! Maybe add a footer?
 mine does the same and it's NOT written in java
 Banjo yea. was thinking that :p
 I best add a member login aswell :p
 hehe
 Anyone here any good with Python ?
 Hey all,

 Thats just your coding Argo ;-)
 shh my coding is fine
 obviously not
 well then maybe you can fix it Pie?
 http://firechips.uuuq.com/test.html
 :S
 anyone?
 I'm afraid you have to do it yourself Argo
 Argo, I can't see whats wrong with it?
 we can help you with solving problems but we can't design it for you
 hmm..
 well... how doi fix the background from going past the images? works fine in IE
 I wonder if I could make an IRC client in PHP using pfsockopen()
 sorry, internet died
 php.net is down ?
 Whooo why so many divs :O
 i care if you say my web design is shit, ive only just started on web design, ive been using photoshop for the best part of 3 years
 Are you going to code it?
 Loads for me Pie`
 not for me :S
 It can't resolve host
 oh tehre we go
 www.php.net wrks
 prop not, coz i wona work on more designs befor i start coding it,
 do you know how to code?
 im learning.
 im new to this kind of stuff, and you lot are allready telling me to stop.
 No, we're telling you its poor
 not to stop
 I never said anything bad about it :P
 you, im just talking to a grate mate of mine, atlest he can tell me whats wronge with it, and how to inprove it,
 "you" ?
 Is that directed at all of us?
 and my new photoshop designs its good for 3rd ever design
 ye prop, i dono
 "5.3.0	 This function is now available on Windows platforms."
 the f...
 PHP 5.2.9 is latest
 Make the area at the top smaller, the slider thing is way to big.
 e lol
 the heck is that..
 theres a random "extra" text input box next to my normal typing area on mirc :S
 oh wait yes 5.3 is released
 so is php 6 :D
 but they're in development stages
 ye i know, but i dont like people sayin ishould binm it -.-
 Well wasn't me so :P
 No one said you should bin it either
 [19:01:31] <%Andrew> shit design anyway, he should throw it away
 acctually Banjo, not true
 Ok i lie
 ah he got to it before me
 Andrew said it
 sorry for being new at this 
 but he's right Hurricane, its not a GREAT design
 but yeh you don't do something based on ONE persons opinion, you don't like it just ignore it.
 just give us a charnce to get the hang of it 
 Try use a bigger variets of colours
 i know its not -.-
 But really you should concentrate on learning html/css before creating al the graphics
 otherwise you're going to have all these pretty images and not a clue how to use them
 i allready know graphics lol
 Thats not what I said.
 i know.
 So...
 [19:38:33] <Hurricane> i allready know graphics lol; pointless comment really.
 ... i will start leaning css and html again after i finished up modeling this car in 3ds max lol
 3d design FTW
 Desktop apps ftw ;-)

 I wanna see the new 2F2f :(
 2f2f?
 You mean f&f? :p
 YES :D
 in holland we call it 2f2f >_>
 but yeah, same thing
 Yeah, that was one of the questions on the questionaire Brandon, if we renamed it, what would we call it :-p
 Haha
 I'd suggest they delete the film and start over.
 With a much cooler name.
 And better actors
 Not convinced it'll be released.
 Like. . Tony Jaa, Steven Segal, Bruce Lee, Jet Li, Van Damme, Chuck Norris, Evlis, Myself, Jackie Chan so on..

 aloha Pie`
 Â¯\(Â°_o)/Â¯
 CONFUSED
 lol
 Tim, what are you confused about?
 My code is going in a book
 :S Like why mine xD
 Tis awesome
 but like
 WOW
 Why is your code going in this book? :o
 I was proof reading the new book on programing for the iPhone OS and rewrote some of the example code in the book for fun neated it up
 showed the author
 and its going in!
 replacing all the authors code
 haha
 how come, $newdata[$i][count($newdata[$i])] = NULL, but $newdata[$i][6] doesn't?
 The array has 6 values in it
 but not all
 which is why I used count($array)
 try doing count on it's own and echo is out
 like echo count($newdata[$i]);
 hmmm
 ah :D
 I was thinking about it the wrong way
 forgot arrays start at 0, so there was 7 values and the 6th was labelled as the last ong
 one *
 so I need to do count($array) - 1
 man I was going to say :(
 %Brandon rubs up against Amy Smart <Â£
 <3*
 Jealous much, Bread?
 :P
 No? Since I know the divide between reality and fiction ;-)
 aww :(

 Best tv show of the ninties was Space Precinct
 I'm actually waiting for "Hangover" the trailer is hilarious
 What the hell exactly is the css style property Azimuth doing?
 	-moz-border-radius: 4px;
 	-webkit-border-radius: 4px;
 ^ Are they w3c compliant tags?
 ... not related.
 :P
 Not sure, why not check?
 Does't seem so
 Property -webkit-border-radius doesn't exist : 4px
 Pie
 they are CSS 3
 thus not a standard
 I use them though
 Query statistics: Since its startup, 2,894 queries have been sent to the server.
 Thats on localhost xD
 Tim they are browser specific, and also don't validate if you select css3 as your validation type
 Yeah they have to be prefixed
 as css3 isnt a standard
 http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-css3-background-20050216/#the-border-radius
 this is the css3 way to do it
 with border-radius

 Latter is the last one or the one near the end, Alex can probably explain it better :-p

 ahh
 can you not just draw the cap under the H1 tag by putting the <div> before the <h1>

 Make WinUp in python ;-)
 wth is winup
 Greetings People of zymic
 Program Me/Andrew are making/made. Like GrabUp but for windows.
 Hey Peeki
 whats it do
 did jack read my request post ? or is he busy
 http://www.winupsite.co.uk/
 what post Peeki?
 last one on here http://www.zymic.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=2127&st=160
 Actually make a program so when you drag files to an icon in the system tray it will upload them to a users ftp account
 ben, the site doesnt load for me
 Banjo
 i downloaded it
 it goes
 Error 53 occured: File not found.
 Yeh thats a broken version
 :S
 Banjo, You could do this easily in php
 I don't know if he has Peeki, sounds good though.
 loll
 but not in Python
 because Python is CLI
 not gui
 but Banjo, I said a place to learn python ;)
 or something to make in php
 :(
 I don't know many languages, I know REALLY basic java, but quite a bit of PHP
 yeah it does sound good banjo, though i dunno how it works, hope its easy enough for jack, and doesnt cause any troubles or security issues
 btw Banjo, theres at least 1 spelling error on winupsite.co.uk ;)
 duce the memory leaks, well iv release
 "iv"
 Andrew did the site
 I'v ;-)
 but you posted it:p
 meh its gonna be redone anyway after my exams
 apparently
 Lies.
 Posted by Banjo on Wednesday March 11, 2009 9:19 pm
 *cough*
 I could make a page stealer :p
 like, to open a socket to a wesite and give the user all the source code written to an html file
 Yeh that would be usefull for me :D
 at school anyway
 Wget does it :p
 wget gets all images too
 and the css
 (If there is one)
 I've got Kate on windows :p
 and Knoquerer
 is python better then php
 lol
 You can't really compare them
 i know asp.net and php, i like asp.net abit better, but php is free >_>
 python can be used as a web language cant it ?
 I believe so.
 Peeki: asp is free as well
 asp.net isnt, lol
 well the asp.net servers cost alot compared to linuix which is free
 lol
 i think u need windows server or something, im not too into that side of things
 Yeh you need windows server to run the code but you can write asp for free, like any language.
 Morning all
 Peeki: ASP.NET is a free technology that allows anyone to create a modern web site.
 http://www.asp.net/
 Morning Robert
 morning
 asp.net is owned by microsoft, >_>.. theres always a catch
 I could write some asp code now and it wouldn't cost me anything :p
 thier IDE cost money, most asp.net scripts run on windows server 20XX which cost $$
 Screw ide's
 id rather use notepad
 Yes
 I really wanna install GNOME on this pc though
 Linux servers cost $$ as well.
 To get Gedit
 well, it cost me the rewritable cd
 lols
 which is 10p ?
 About that
 asp.net depending on how big your site is, i think they charge you more and more >_> lols
 brb gonna wash my hair
 The biggest cost has been time...
 asp.net webhosting usally cost alot more then php
 :p
 I can get a reel of 100 CD-R's for ~£7
 Such as now... Appears my parents internet has altered how it works
 so I don't actually know how to connect any more :p
 asp isn't worth the haslle, and which is why most fo teh sites which use asp are acctually microsoft owned sites anyway
 asp and asp.net are different though lol
 D:
 yeh, asp and asp.net
 6 Months Free on DotNetNuke Web Hosting!!
 All Versions of DotNetNuke Supported
 ASP.NET 3.5 & ASP.NET 2.0
 i didnt really like asp
 ^ Can't be all bad?
 asp.net is pretty good lol
 I'd still go with PSP
 PHP *
 as It's open source :p
 and open sourcing si the way forward!
 I agree for web based stuff
 not really for anything else
 brb cod4
 yeh php is awesome as well lol
 I'm trying to move away from PHP
 really robert ?
 how come ?
 Too web based
 oh i see
 Also, allows slack coding
 you have a point
 I want something stricter
 yeh !! i agree with that >_>
 I made a perfectly good IRC bot in PHP
 But, atm I don't have time to learn C++
 php suports slack coding like no tommrow >_>
 I have 3?
 I wanna learn C/C++/Python
 1 connected atm
 learn C#
 Robert, You could learn Perl
 its a lot like PHP, but not web based
 although it can be
 No, I'm going for C++
 if u learn asp.net, you could code with 2 languages, C# and Vb.net
 asp is platform based
 limits you
 h
 hi
 what do u mean by platform based?
 asp.net/c# pretty much requires windows servers
 meaning you have to pay for windows license
 yeh
 lol
 thats what i was saying before
 and meaning you lose LOTS of performance
 since windows servers are crap
 yeh lols
 hahah :P
 windows is like a truck
 liniux is like a motor bike
 lol
 only if it's a motorbike that can carry 20 tonnes of load
 anyways, is perl any good ?
 yeh lols
 nope
 perl is dead
 learn python
 whats the new go these days ?
 python ?
 yes
 lol my uni jumped on the python bandwagon really fast
 but they said it was just a stepping stone into programming
 not really too practical.. 
 well
 well i think thats what they said, since i didnt really do the unit
 depends on what you want to do
 you can build web apps with python better than with php (more OS hooks etc)
 true oop
 whats web apps ?
 i love oop 
 php pisses me off sometimes lol
 sites
 etc
 look at djangoproject.com
 for the most practical way to build sites in python
 u seen any good python sites ?
 does zymic suport python ?
 ovh.co.uk is written in perl
 Peeki
 gmail/youtube are built with python
 yes?
 really ? youtube as well ?
 yes
 browsershots.org is built with python and django framework
 why did google purchase youtube.com
 http://python.org/about/success/
 what was special about it ?
 success stories about using python
 Peeki, youtube uses more than 10% of the ENTIRE INTERNET's bandwidth
 yeh cause u watch one video, its like ur downloading 1000's of sites lol
 they must had some revolutionary coding
 or some optimization of videos or something
 that was new at the time
 python vs php, cons and pros ?
 bbl
 Good song.
 yeah that song rocks :D
 Who here has a CV ?
 Robert, you must have one as you went to that interview the other day :p
 CV for job?
 Yes
 No, not for that job
 But I do have one
 I got 6 T_T
 The interview I just went to didn't need one
 Why so many?
 And why Brandon?
 May I see it? :)
 Which one?
 Maths or Programming?

 Brandon, what happened to your ops?
 There
 there ya' go
 swordz???
 using te onfocus element
 to make an input box empty itself when click would it be
 onfocus="this.value=''"
 yeah I guess
 onfocus=this.value=""
 ^ thats it
 onfocus=' this.value="" '
 mine works jsut as good :D
 try this ^
 However, that's not a good usecase
 well I don't think it's valid html
 Are you trying to do something like having "search..." by default, and then get rid of it when the user clicks on it?
 its not for me anyway, someone just asked me how to do it
 Because if so, you'd be better off doing if(this.value == 'search...') this.value='';
 To avoid wiping actual user-input
 also there is an element for the first value like search... right ?
 hi guys
 hi help
 I don't know its not for me
  i want help when i try to add domain name it says error
 I was just asked how to clear a user input bo when its clicked on
 help, please join #hosting, I'll assist in there.
 ok 
 Well, pass on the answer in full with that caveat in case it's useful
 Problem solved
 Next please! ;)
 Hi Alex :p
 Oh dear
 Sure there wasn't anyone ahead of you in the queue, Brandon?
 Nope
 Lets pretend its just me, kai? :p
 Not sure, ok, well, in that case I guess we'll have to formalise the system a bit more
 I'll write up some numbered cards, and people can come and collect them here
 Sounds like a waste of time :p
 Why do you think I'm here? ;)
 Hard one to decide
 Guess so, maybe I should've started with the key stage 1 stuff
 Yeah. Maybe you should start now?
 hi all
 how do i hide?
 Find an hiding place? :P
 a*
 Favourites include: under the bed, in the cupboard, behind curtains
 man
 Or in the car
 mibbit is talking to me
 it says
 Brandon hides
 it also says brandon sighs now
 Yep, IRC does that
 Oh dear
 They're actions
 /me does something
 how to do that?
 I just showed you
 ^
 It's the /me at the beginning that does it
 /me test
 ???? D:
 No space
 there is no space
 i just did
 /me test
 :(
 Sure you didn't do //me test
 Pie`: What IRC client?
 lulz u guys got trolled
 ./msg #zymic /me test
 XD
 O_o
 Yeah, pretty much what I was insinuating
 The double slash does the same thing without needing to do /msg
 At least on this client
 And I think on most, x-chat does it as well that I know of
 naw it does skips the first /
 however, /////////ME Unknown command
 doesnt :D
 It might on other clients, I don't think it's standard
 //me had three slashes at the begginnnig for me though
 One of the reasons IRC isn't really amenable to pasting PHP, because you get one-line comments coming out as
 / comment
 someone come play uno with me, #uno
 :d
 Which of course then isn't valid.
 whats the opposite tag to onFocus /
 onblur
 thanks

 Hey Brandon, could you do me a favor?
 Which might be?
 NO :P
 The hosting you gave me, could you change it to a different ending
 like instead of /~waddlete
 Excuse me ? :/
 could you change it to something else
 Why?
 Sort out a domain? :p
 I need it changed to fit the website Im building
 hmm
 .co.cc...
 co.cc sucks
 better than nothing
 and better than a subdomain
 He has one but they take for ever to pro... something
 propagate
 yeah, it still isnt working
 and got it like 3 weeks ago
 What nameservers is it?
 mine are normally quite quick
 the ones you gave me
 What's the domain?
 what you mean?
 Nevermind brandon
 Watch he'll tell me it works now :p
 No, I'll just figure out something else, a uni.cc domain

 perry is this : http://villatregua.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/DSC00535.119214659_std.JPG :: in florida?
 Looks like all the new homes in florida.
 I hate living here, all the new homes look teh same. It's annoying.
 not sure, i found it on google images
 No, andrew
 It says its French
 http://www.firsthomebuilders.com/ go there, click "choose a model" and then look at your options. they all look the same.
 They are one of the big home building companies down here, and they are cheaper than custom homes, so ALOT of people use them
 It's annoying.
 Its actually a home made to rent out for vacations. Says it starts at $450$/night
 You live in florida?
 Yea fort myers
 Yes, he's a pedo don't talk to him ;'P
 Me or perry brandong?
 LMFAO BRANDONG!!!
 I made myself laugh.
 lol hahaha
 Thinking of my dong are we Andrew|Away? :o
 Mehbeh
 All t hose houses are the same :|
 Thought so
 I know perry, all the houses in cape coral (on the other side of the river) look like that, it's just annoying. 
 Why are they so low down :/
 O.o low down?
 My garage is so much bigger than them xD
 Yes, where is the upstairs? :/
 None.
 lmao you don't find many 2 story houses in florida
 There's maybe 1 every 10 blocks
 :P
 No basements either
 :/
 How much is a house like that down there?
 Now or at their prime?
 Now
 new I don't know, but you can find them now (from foreclosures) for around $100,000 or less
 prime they were going for high $200's
 Ohh, thats not bad.
 How much is flood insurance :P
 or hurricane insurance
 I don't know, we've never had any
 We've always rented
 Ah
 somebody stole pictures o_O
 omg..
 ?
 omg, this house in my area going for $3 million :OOOOOOOO

 God damn
 $4 a month heh
 Fucking Konqueror won't open
 Lot is 490050000 sq. ft.
 :O
 heck id buy that and never see it..
 that definately has to be a mistake
 I'm thinking that...
 but I'd probably sell it asap
 providing the price goes up :p
 I'm thinking the acres number, is supposed to be the sq ft
 But I also recon mistake
 Andrew that by you?
 brb
 Hey Banjo
 gah, cant find good pics of the house, ofc only thr crap one's
 Hey, not staying long just popped on for a break.
 ic
 Got LOTS of revision to do.
 I'm on Kubuntu :O
 I like kubuntu

 Permission to talk?
 NEVER :d
 Is that +v?
 http://www.cinema.philips.com/?ls=gb_en

 [15:29] *** Banjo gives Dolleh permission to talk.
 Thats a beautiful tv :O
 ic
 TheOracle, you using konversation ?
 :O
 yer
 She has it anyway
 :D
 Anyone know of a good AV for Kubuntu?
 Ok well just to let you know i probs won't be on till next week or so, so don't miss me to much ;-)
 aww thats long :(
 TheOracle, AV ?
 Wait, does Kubuntu 9.04 even exist?
 can I have your tea then?
 Antivirus
 psh, you dont need AV on linux
 rly?
 yes, rly
 orly?
 YES RLY
 btw, kubuntu 9.04 isnt out
 Hrm
 because i have the 2nd msot recent kubuntu release on lie cd
 and thats only 8.1
 ugh i hate from cms.. i had to edit the config file and to do that i needed to give it right access and i did that updated and uploaded then placed it back to 555 no write access and not it wont run cause it found the file to be writable...
 wait
 The taskbar thing says I can upgrade to 9.04
 i take that back
 "Latest update: 9.04 is Out in the Wild"
 http://www.kubuntu.org/news/9.04-release
 Hrm
 TheOracle, try in terminal: sudo apt-get install quassel
 its better than konversation imo :p
 ok :O
 Should I upgrade Kubuntu?
 did u use live cd
 or what
 I used Wubi
 that would have installed 9.04 im guessing
 and if you could upgrade to 9.04, t would tell you there are system updates available
 It says an upgrade to Kubuntu 9.04 is available
 And terminal couldn't find quassel
 type quassel into terminal
 see what u get
 no wait XD
 quassel is now default
 so you wont need ot instal it
 itll already be there
 I don't see it
 applications > internet > quassel
 [21:37:17] <+TheOracle> It says an upgrade to Kubuntu 9.04 is available
 oh duh
 Not there
 quassel is deafult for 9.04
 Ah
 Ok, lemme upgrade then
 jsut upgrade
 it doesnt take long
 and it installs the new KDe
 which looks nicer
 Jaunty Kackalope xd

 Ermm, google.co.uk seems to have loads of links that leads to many other links ;')
 how do you make it so your site can register domain names?
 because then I could get em free D: 
 You have to have a domain reseller
 but how do you start at the first step
 What is the first step you talking about?
 where you acctually register the domains yourself
 your not a reseller
 registrar
 ^ probably
 costs a huge amount to set up
 Oh that lol
 Tunage
 hmm
 Tis broken =[
 ewwwwwww R&B
 its just scared of you brandon
 xD
 Dlw ]
 I had every intention on doing that. *shifty eyes*
 i'm listening to 50 cent o_O omg unhealthy

 LOL.
 Better than taking a final for Failure Mechanics
 Engineering?
 Yup
 Swap you for Theoretical Physics?
 LOL...I hated physics
 I took physics I, II, III
 Yeah, but I imagine that's physics you can actually see
 I liked physics :(

 I'm using Quassel atm
 Gotta go
 Final is about to start
 C'ya
 TheOracle, imo its better than konversation
 Yea
 I noticed
 im installing xubuntu atm :D
 Why xubuntu?
 Old computer?
 bcause ive never used it
 and no
 other hard drive
 ic
 wubi cheats :P
 ittorrents the iso down
 then it hink mounts it
 but i havent got that far yet
 I'm afraid to reboot though, I got more than a couple errors upgrading
 weird O_o
 Although it never prompted me to upgrade
 what like
 er, restart*
 Like, operation is invalid, configuration for this package is already done, etc
 oh thats probably because you updated a program but the program doesnt know that yet
 like when i was on ubuntu once
 and i upgrade
 firefox screwed up
 ic ty
 until i restarted, it was because it had been updated along with the system upgrade
 ah
 ty
 its checking xubuntu installation files now D:
 Thats odd
 it just finished downloading them
 so yeah
 It says I have insufficient rights to rename a desktop shortcut
 restart your pc
 i bet you will fix it :p
 :(
 What if it goes ka-blooey
 IT'LL BE ALL YOUR FAULT
 wait
 download an ubuntu iso
 burn it to a cd-r
 then restart
 No. :(
 Why?
 if it doesn't work boot ubuntu up into live mode
 :D
 then isntall ubuntu
 If it doesn't work, I'll reboot into WinXP and forget about it
 Hopefully
 D:
 Well, brb
 is installed as dual boot
 or what
 Well
 It gives you the choice at boot time
 yeah itinstalled GRUB :P
 Wot be that
 the boot loader
 Oh

 Yes

 Netherlands ?
 ooh
 Im in the us..?
 :P
 We had another perry once
 he stole my name!?
 In advance, yes
 Are you sure it wasnt me? I havent been around for months
 i think it was me. i had been around for a while but stopped coming around until now
 how have u been alex?
 Lies.
 Perry, the old perry was a dirt bag etc.
 Apparently you've been away long enough to forget how pedantic I am ;)
 you*
 I'm fine, you?
 Not too bad. you still designing and whatnot?
 I've never been any good at design, I was doing the markup/backend stuff
 And not so much since I started uni
 Banjo
 Eng lit is awesome
 need any help
 ask
 hehe ok thanks :D
 Tim: I take it you do it then?
 if mice and men
 *of
 I do banjo
 :)
 I did that book in year 9 dronix :)
 Was rather good imo.
 Haha
 you can stop downloading thx
 k
 Mice of Men is win.
 Ending was good
 No its not
 not at all
 Rest was almost painfully slow
 yeah it was good, did that in high school too
 It's an awful book
 I liked watching the film most though
 i hate that book
 Same
 Try reading something likeâ¦
 the old man and the sea
 No
 What a rubbish book!
 why do u hate it? kill the rabbit
 Something more political
 that was just as bad
 Had that in my test today
 I think
 Nineteen Eighty-four is a must read
 Political eh, are we heading for Orwell
 Oh, we are
 crank :)
 :D
 Alex
 Well done
 Animal Farm
 Iv reaad a bit of that.
 another good Orwell
 :D
 Yeah, read both
 read*
 How about some Catch 22 too
 and maybe some Venguent (however its spelt) with Slaughter House Five
 That I haven't
 Oh an catcher in the rye
 a book for all young men
 Not necessarily a bad thing
 Banjo
 one thing to consider
 It's a shit ton of writing
 The guardian has ben goldacre's bad science column
 Yeh I know, Im taking 3 essay subjects :S
 I took three C/W heavy ones too
 and then crashed in exam weeks
 LIFE FAIL
 Haha
 Maths, Further Maths, Chemistry, Physics and Computing.  Not a bad set until you get to Computing ;)
 Alex
 I got a U for CPT6
 I might see if I can change my IT subject I chose (Don't ask why, I don't know :( ) to something else.
 He didnt understand it
 So he failed you?
 Maybe a real world commercial iPhone application was too over his head
 Yes
 What an utter tit
 Complain your ass off
 hes dept head
 no one to moan to
 The head? :P
 The governing body
 The exam board
 http://img207.imageshack.us/img207/6416/apdesign.jpg - last time ill ask for reviews on this. sorry haha just making final changes. thoughts everyone? thanks :)
 The local paper ;)
 haha
 Way too much spacing at the top there
 Between the navigation and the content, alex?
 Yes
 Looks empty, not minimalist/spacious :p
 Should i add something in, or move it down
 I'd try just moving it, but I have little creativity ;)
 Maybe ill move the logo and nav down, add a bar at the top for login?
 Tim, I think the local paper would quite like to run "student failed by teacher's incompetence" :p
 how about an image Perry
 Haha
 such as what, dronix?
 Alex I don't think they'd run it
 I told him I dont care that he gave it a U
 it made me 700Â£
 don't know, something that'll cover the width of that container
 hmm, hold on
 :O Lies, really?
 He's pretty clearly wrong to fail you, shame you're letting it pass :p
 Unless your report was shite ;)
 lol
 ahh was just about to say that lol
 Still, if you're gonna get a U in anything, that's probably the best one apart from General Studies :p
 Pretty useless subject as I found applying to universities
 grrrrr
 i dont know wtf to add to get rid of this emptyspace!
 did you try the image?
 i dont know what kind of image i would add
 im trying to come up with something to add the very top
 on top of the logo?
 yes.
 the very very top
 hmm, not sure it'll look right, logo looks good there

 There's no need to be using ie6 still, not when they are a full two versions ahead
 hehe, nah i don't use it. Used to on my desktop as its the only browser installed on it. I use chrome and ff
 ... theres no reason to be using IE period.

 And you cant use plugins that make remote connections

 WTF, rebel, http://www.rwarmedia.com/ has the logo changed?
 Oh I know why x'D
 Brandon, isn't it rawr? not rwar
 Just added 'We like it.' above rwarmedia
 Maybe
 http://rawrmedia.co.uk
 hey guys
 rwar looks like you have a typo in your text
 I can't be asked to changed it.
 It is
 Wasn't able to drop the domains so I'm going to keep them and keep the name
 Just as good I guess.
 Unique :'P
 the last one has rawr and not rwar
 Brandon: if you finish designing it before monday I can code it for you ;)
 I have a coder but thanks :)
 Andeh ?
 No
 Andy doesn't code for free ;-)
 haha
 is it gonna be that tall Brandon ? the page I mean
 Could someone write me a regular expression which would get the url from this <img> tag?
 <img id="item_image" src="http://itemdb-rs.runescape.com/2640_obj_big.gif?id=1631" alt="Uncut dragonstone"> 
 rebel, http://clients.crownstyles.com/MarketingMore/ it was orignaly that but the person didn't like it so I'm re-doing bits then going to attempt to sell it :'P
 Pie`: what do you mean ?
 I want the src element
 but ONLY the link
 you mean like a javascript command ?
 Brandon: why didn't he like it ?
 Ermm, it was for a compition
 Competition
 rebel, I need it to be regex
 isn't that considered cheating ?
 rebel: He preferd this; http://99designs.com/designs/1800516-original
 Brandon: where do you get your clients ?
 That's 99designs
 When I get clients from crownstyles they want coding which I can't do so i send them else where :'P
 So, I tell a lie and say I'm very busy and wont beable to do it. Rather than I can't code go to ... x'D
 haha, how many you get like this ?
 these *
 This month about 10/11 people
 how about I code them for you and get a share ?
 How well can you code? :'O
 I'm good
 Pie`: interesting, I would say
 Something like
 <img( [^=>]+="([^\\">]|\\\\)*")* src="([^\\">]|\\\\)*"( [^=>]+="([^\\">]|\\\\)*")*> would do
 ;o
 Sorry, got a bit of that wrong, well, it will work for most things already
 I probably won't need it anyway ;)
 but thanks
 That's sort of assuming you want to be sure it's just the <img> that it grabs, if you're already sure of that it's easier
 Just src="([^\\">]|\\\\|\\")*" (and that change to the parenthesised subpattern should be in all three of the original
 Have I missed half a conversation or something?
 Who, Bread?
 Oh, I just needed to scroll up :P
 wouldn't this be better suited to DOM?
 Meh
 Has anyone here ever set up dual monitors on ubuntu before?
 Yes, though with a nvidia card it's almost all GUI
 Set up 3 too, but you don't need to know that :-p
 What graphics card have you got Pie`?
 nvidia 8600gt
 I'm having problems with the nvidia x server
 It won't show that I've got 2 monitors
 So I can't set the second up :(
 Ah it's a doddle then, I found using EnvyNG had better results 
 sudo apt-get install envyng-gtk
 I'm not on it atm
 I guess I could restart though
 :D
 brb then
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8F495aMd50&NR=1
 thats crazy
 I laughed so hard when he puled the uzi + shotgun out
 I bet you can notice the shotgun when he's walking, but the others can be concealed pretty easily
 gah, back, run and hide!!! its back :O
 %Brandon has Nik Naks <'3
 jealous
 D:
 oo gimme
 I have a sausage sandwich
 ive not eaten yet
 n its 2:30
 I had one last night :D
 Bread, this favour is 'RibnSaucy' :)
 Ahah, I prefer the nicenspicy ones
 :P
 I'm with Bread on this one
 :D
 Me too.
 I don't like spicy food
 You know the awlkers competition
 their new flavours or w/e
 Only what shop had and BBQ mini cheeders :P
 Apparently Builders Breakfast won
 I wanted fish n chips :(
 Never tried any of the new flavours
 Aww
 Most of them tasted a bit weird
 like the crispy duck and hoisin
 Cajun squirrel was good though :D
 They still selling the others?
 Walkers made one whee it has a 'drive' flavour :/
 I think so
 Ahah
 I need to get some decent CD writing software
 Windows media play sucks so bad at  it
 Nero?
 nero
 I still think the best flavour walkers make is Worcester sauce
 player*
 I <3'd the worcester sauce flavour D:
 Agreed
 and Marmite
 Never was too keen on Marmite flavour
 Marmite D: =[
 I hate marmite
 but loved the crisps
 Marmine is eww.
 whats good for cd burning
 && free
 k3b
 there ain't no such thing as a free lunch
 Ah, I love marmite, but didn't like the crisps heh. Twiglets are the only marmite flavoured crisps I like
 ofc.. guys talking about food again.. lol
 marious, windows
 *cry* :(
 I agree with marious :P
 sorry... only use linux lol
 I normally do
 but i booted into windows to play cod4, but then found out it broke anyway
 ask osalt.com
 and then couldnt be bothered to restart
 http://www.osalt.com/nero
 all that trouble for not restarting
 screw it, I'll just get it off warez-bb
 CDRDAO and InfraRecoder eh?
 I haz nero
 +Dolleh <3 nero
 I used to
 but lost it
 ;]
 uh
 Nero is so damn heavy
 theres a portable version
 portable == light
 ah yes it should
 no idea haha
 you might be able to run k3b with kde on windows: http://windows.kde.org/
 got that Bread
 but
 Does it work well?
 It said I could find packages on the installer or something, but theres no dpkg :(
 It works perfectly Bread, no bugs so far
 Nice. How well does it interface with the underlying filesystem?
 Fine I guess, althought I have no idea what you just said :D
 Well does it allow you to save in all your windows directories etc
 yeah
 Nifty
 Might have to fire up my vm and give it a whirl at some point
 http://www.workatplay.com/
 ^ try the navigation buttons
 is that hosted here rebel?
 nope just found it at webdesignerwall.com
 ah ok
 Does not works without javascript
 only works if i enter the site without javascript from the beggining
 and the about page is bad
 yeah its using javascript for the page rollover
 uh
 http://www.contrast.ie/
 hahaha
 that page was funny
 lol @ âThe footerâ
 the whole site is on one page
 Now it is better
 without javascript works too
 What for?
 http://www.gpacheco.fr
 Pay for cPanel for server
 Heh, oh dear
 :P
 Loan it to you for a return of $60 ;)
 Heh, yea right.
 it's one of the biggest sins in islam to do that Alex
 this is why there is "Islamic" Banks
 It was considered the same in Christianity as well, they made the Jews do it for them.  Usary.
 I'm aware of that, but I'm agnostic, so I'm ok with it ;)
 so it's ok in Judaism ? because most of islam teachings come from Judaism 
 I don't think so, but they were told to
 money is money, religion is something extra to carry in your bag
 hmm :S
 And it ended up making them wealthy, and helped to foster the stereotype of money grabbing Jewish people.
 That they didn't want to originally is usually ignored ;p
 haha
 well that explains a lot of things
 many muslims say the Jews control west countries
 it's a kind of a conspiracy theory
 Yeah, those tend to develop
 Apparently Iran still blames almost anything that goes wrong on some unseen British hand :p
 bye
 Hizbulla blames israel for everything like that last German report about who killed Hariri
 also it's not always politics
 hi
 yellow
 hey
 http://madebyelephant.com/
 Guys, who knows a good designer?
 rebel is awesome
 webdesignerwall.com is awesome
 madebyelephant.com/ isn't loading for me
 Andy, Tim and Adam are all very good
 Adam, are you alive? ;-)
 Brandon's pretty good too.
 Maybe.
 O hai Adam =]
 yur not a zombie are you? :O
 do they have portfoliols?
 *portfolios
 plugin-visual: go for Brandon
 My portfolio is shite.
 plugin-visual: andy's portfolio: http://iam-andy.co.uk/
 oki :)
 His email is on there, says if you are interested then email him
 whats andy's nick?
 andy :-p
 He's not been on for a bit
 oh ic
 who made iam-andy.co.uk ?
 andy?
 andy
 andy i suppoes
 Yeah, he made his own portfolio :p
 heh
 lolk, well theres no link to the FAQ page on your second visit to the site
 That's the point ;)
 It says "looks like this is your first time here"
 but then theres no link
 after that
 it should link to "FAQ" in the footer or something
 I suppose, but if it was down there, no one would follow the link afterwards anyway I expect
 Craig's pretty good too: http://craigsworks.com 
 http://www.azcentral.com/offbeat/articles/2009/05/05/20090505beerpong.html
 wow...
 http://iam-andy.co.uk/faq.html
 what is cregs nick?
 ouch, spelling mistake...
 Greg?
 lol k
 Craig, but he only ever comes on IRC if I tell him :-p
 ic
 Yea
 for me :P
 When are you actually going to use that simplejax logo, Ed :p
 Haha
 Didn't realise andy designed pastesite
 His portfolio is linked in the footer, aye
 You obviously don't look at the footer :P
 No
 Never do
 Heh, when I finally get some time :-p
 There's never anything there
 I note that footer is out of date
 I usually php the dates down there
 :P
 Apparently I forgot this time around
 Alex being forget full ;o
 woah
 forgetful*
 Yea :P
 aha!
 I didn't think it was possible to cd to directorys that contained a space in their name using linux
 but if you escape the spce you can :p
 Or you can " " the path
 cd "~/path/to/dir with spaces"
 cd /home/noah/Desktop/c-drive/Program\ Files/
 :d
 Yes, I was giving an alternative :p
 escaping it seem seasier imo
 thats smilie looks weird pie`
 Guys, does anyone have craigs msn?
 Tab-completion will also automatically escape spaces for you
 but its all down to preference really
 "msn:  craig@craigsworks.com"?
 There, footer fixed, and now I don't have to look at it again :p
 ah, ok
 Does craig go on the zymic irc?
 Apparently only when Ed makes him
 http://pastesite.com/7278 What?
 Robert, I don't tihnk he can get ftp working :L
 Maybe
 I just thought seeing it was random
 I'm off
 bye people
 but i cant seem to get the program i am trying to work on it to transfer 
 night
 Bugger off you old git Robert
 ^ Makes no sense really D:
 bye
 arevoir rebort
 oops, meant robert
 ll..o
 dronix, isn't it, au revoir?
 lol* damned
 don't know pie`, just typed and it sounded good
 http://www.thefreedictionary.com/au+revoir
 ;]
 plugin-visual: I'll ring him now
 http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/technology/newsid_8068000/8068323.stm o.O
 he's coming
 plugin-visual: ^^
 Afternoon :)
 Hey craig
 Who invited you ;-)
 Hey Brandon :) How's it going?
 Good thanks. Yourself?
 Slightly tired but good! Bloody sod Ed woek me up :P
 haha XD
 s/woek/woke
 Aww :P
 Indeed!
 Well you managed to do an exam with no sleep, this shouldn't be any different ;-)
 Good point... although I think I failed so that's probably not a good sign how this will end :P
 He slept'd really just an excuse just incase he did bad :P
 Possibly...
 haha, smart one brandon lol
 No comment ;D
 :P
 Yea yea, what exam craig?
 Material Science *YAWN*
 Sounds it
 Yeah like I need to know the properties of amorphous window glass and its consituent former and modifer cations
 How very bloody useful! But no choice really :P
 Science is... crap =[
 I did some materials stuff as a part of physics, that was dull.
 Glad I don't have to do anything seriously
 On the plus side.... our lecturer looks like a Wizard
 Not sure why thats a plus... but it definitely was.
 And that's why I'm not doing any construction related engineering :)
 Anti-wizards Alex?
 What type of Engineering you doing Alex?
 RACIST!
 Software Engineering
 lol @ dolleh
 The kind of engineers who's managers think they can do your job as well as you can
 "I use Microsoft Word, how much harder can it be to make software"
 Haha... sounds about right
 Electrinoc engineer here. Cybernetics ftw!
 So we end up being quite good at improvising ;)
 s/Electinoc/Electronic
 Because we get requests similar to "you know that building you've almost finished?  We've decided we'd like a basement now" to a civil engineer
 Ah, fair enough, someone has to do it :P
 Except in comparison to a building, there's no need to uproot the house to add it ;)
 The hardware side of electronics just passes me by
 craig: well, like in a house you'd have to completely rework the foundations
 craig: that's the similarity I'm getting at :p
 *whoosh*
 craig
 Went straight over my head that one... I think I may need a bit more sleep haha
 Hi plugin-visual :)
 hi :)
 Because in a house you'd have to dig through the foundations to build the basement, and then you'd have to put in deeper foundations to support the extra weight
 Just PM'd you about somethin
 On the software side, alterations cause huge issues for the framework, general design of the system and integration issues.
           POW
 Haha :)
 alex you freelance? or do you work for a company?
 At the moment mostly neither :P
 Uni keeps me fairly busy
 ah ic
 How do I get to my PM list rofl... this is embarassing
 OH there it is
 should have a new window
 I had the channel list minimized... doh!
 Haha, someone's a bit sleepy ;-)
 your fault bread :D
 give some bread to the guy
 I'm looking to work summers, and I have a placement year after my next academic one
 I prefer the slapping
 heh
 So, the 2010-2011 year I'll be working somewhere
 Not sure where yet :p
 how many years do you have left until you finish uni?
 I finish mid 2013
 ah ic, I have to do another 4 years since I changed my major
 Mine is a five year course, four academic years and a year in industrial placement
 But leave with a MEng, so that's ok by me
 Same here :(. I had to do a foundation course as I had no Math A Level
 doh!
 Plus full exemption to apply directly for Chartered Software Engineer
 But still.... an extra year of being a fresher is fine by me ;) Freshers girls and freshers booze!
 Haha, fair enough
 I went straight in, I had done maths :p
 I got denied to do it because I only got a B :(
 Bad times...
 At GCSE?
 Yeah... but I couldn't only get a B beause I was placed in Middle group... go figure hm :P I got 100% too
 Heh, nice, sounds like the school sort of failed putting you there
 My college they let you go in with a C or above I think
 But it was a pretty big maths department
 1/3rd of the place was maths and the three sciences
 Yeah definitely school failure to say the least... but what can you do I guess? Another year at Uni is fine by me tbh... especially in this recession
 Did you pay fees for the foundation year?  Because that's a bit of a sting
 :( i lost my scholarship so I'm currently paying for my uni
 Heh, my scholarship was only £1k, so I couldn't have paid for it with that if I wanted to
 Not even a third of one years fees
 It was good to have, free money is always nice :P
 my scholarship was more than enough, had an additional 1k to spend every month, thats how I bought my laptop
 Yeah... an extra £3500 in debt because of it...
 *every semester not month
 I wish I had a scholorship :( Feeling the pinch not having a job atm... 
 But what can you do I guess =P
 That's what overdraft's for amirite?
 get a job?

 Haha that was a class act. Even Simon put him through
 craig, that wasn't an act
 well, his poetry was
 but that was REALLY him
 That's what I was reffering to ;) I had trouble believing it was his actual voice etc at first but obviously the tabloids had their way with him

 Grand Exchange parser?
 Theres another script busy parsing the Grand Exchange
 stickign output into sql db
 because parsing data from gedb itself takes a while
 a good 30secs per request
 Ahh I see, so you gonna have it update the db like every day or so?
 yeah
 I was thinking every 4 hours
 but the speed its going atm
 I may have to do every 24
 Nice, I made a desktop application that parses the Grand Exchange, it takes a while to retrieve the info because the site is rather slow.
 it was you! :P
 You posted that on Juw's site didn't you
 was made in .NET
 Yep
 My friend wanted to use your idea in a site
 which he mananged to drag me into, you remember fellixombc ?
 Have a newer version i made but haven't uploaded
 Yep I remember him, hot him on msn.
 got*
 I got dragged into that :p
 the site died in the end anyway, so it never went anywhere
 ahh lol i see
 this ge parser has done a good 4.5k pages so far
 I know how i can improve it
 but its gotta run > once for me to do it
 cool story bro
 thnx
 Sweet

 yes
 http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/The_game
 shit, not the answer i wanted
 do you guys allow ads? like google adsense?
 Yes
 providing its not for a spammy MFA site
 Jack, of course not
 Jack, is there any reason why the ads would not show up after just cut and pasting the scipt that google gives you into the body of a webpage?
 It usually takes 20 minutes
 opera keeps segfaulting today :/
 Jack, would'nt there be like a blank box or something? or does it take time for that to show up too?
 takes time
 blank

 128 core ?
 thats what it says
 In November 2008, a patent-pending method appeared which purports to combine rainbow tables with a system to keep track of the key space covered by the rainbow table and this methodology has been called a Thunder Table(tm) by its inventors. In combination with a 128 core GPU, rainbow table look-up and construction is now 25 times faster than using a conventional CPU.[6]

 You could I would say with minimal effort and maybe $xx,xxx build something with a thousand cores using GPUs
 come on guys it's just the underline
 Alex look in #hosting please.
 i wanna get rid of the underline from underbeatg home, about, contact and archives

 gimliglider: well, pastesite does, so you can find them there
 oh yeah...!
 and also, assholes like to ruin the forums and use a proxy :(
 thanks wait i didn't think of that!
 there is somehting like navigator at line 360, not div.navigator
 also do you want me to add the {} brackets or no?
 gimliglider: in this case, they're equivalent because .navigator is only used on a <div> tag
 oh ok
 Alex, mind telling a person that manages the hosting site to cancel my account?
 Say that you want it done in #hosting, and provide your username
 Then one of them can get back to you to verify you're the owner
 Or you could just delete everything off the hosting, it's basically the same thing
 gimliglider: you don't want more than one set of braces for each section
 So I meant add in "text-decoration: none;" to those sections
 Or actually, there's already a text-decoration in that second section
 So you'd just replace that with "none" instead of "underline"
 wow thanks that worked like a charm. Instant and precise headshot!
 PcGamer, if you're looking to block HTTP Proxies on your forums, this will help a little: http://pastesite.com/7489
 it just blocks all connections from which port 80 is forwarded, and 9 times out of 10 its not just a normal user.
 well Pie` all my stuff's gone now so it doesnt help
 don't leave me :(
 I have to :(
 http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/eula_dev.html?dl=mac
 Chrome for Mac
 brandon will keep you company!!
 and adam
 Linux version is available too
 Both unstable
 And for Linux, I know
 Early developer releases though
 Not intended for public use at all
 Ah well
 I'm not the public
 bye restarting wierd comp behaviour
 I can't wait for true release of chrome for linux
 going to be so epi
 brb
 although I doubt it will be as fast as firefox w/ tmpfs
 I'll be waiting in bed, Brandon and Adam.
 oeh...
 I quite like Chrome :)
 Adam, I keep changign back to firefox because I've got some epic addons installed, but chrome keeps dragging me back kicking a screaming
 Plugins are gay
 Is that what you tell yourself in vain trying to pretend Safari's any good ;)
 I like speed
 I couldn't care less about plugins
 Though, Safari 4 isn't terrible, before that though it was kinda embarassing how much it lacked compared to other browsers
 What plugins do you have that are couldn't live without?
 you*
 Hmmm, what do I have that I use fairly often
 ColorZilla for some things, that I could live without, but would rather have a built in eye-dropper than go to a screenshot in gimp or something
 you ever tried watching an animated gif in chrome?
 much better
 I can actually use numbers now!
 brb
 Have u guys heard about Google Wave?
 Thats going to rock when its properly released.
 ColorZilla doesn't work on linux :(
 wave is good
 what's wave ?
 extension ?
 look it up on youtube
 youtube ?
 but basically, its this email/im sort of thing thats run completly in browser, no applets no addons
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_UyVmITiYQ
 http://wave.google.com/
 video is a bit long, but watch first like 15 mins, you'll get the jist of it
 it looks really good
 https://services.google.com/fb/forms/wavesignupfordev/
 Are you pain tolerant enough to work with APIs that are still in flux? * - Yeah! I walk on fire and swim with sharks. - Maybe, I mean I jaywalk sometimes... - Not really, arm floaties and seatbelts please!

 What? :/
 You mean mock up ?
 yeah sorry
 mock up
 Okay, no it' not.
 brandon
 I has a php script that takes a font and makes whatever text you want into an image, simple stuff really but it's already done. You can use it to dynamically create those titles on bigroper
 <img src="text.php?She's Getting it hard">
 etc
 Just have to figure out how to create the white outline like you have already
 and how to tilt it a bit
 I see
 You mean the drop shadow ?
 That can be done with CSS3 :P
 hmm
 Brandon: where did you get the images ? :P
 I'll bbs

 and if you set s, you can choose sha1/md5
 woot! have fun!
 otherwise it picks for you, i tihnk
 they don't have a rainbow table

 and yourself?
 Did you win?
 lol
 Sounds fun, should of done paintballin' tbh. I did nothing as per usual, raining here =[
 I'm going to blame Frank.
 Rain? I got sun burnt today!
 What?
 Jack been sunny all week but today =[
 I got sun burnt on me nose lol
 I got sun burnt on my shoulder/back
 Won one of the games Jack, the last game we were so bored we started bowling the slowest :P
 :)
 And it peeled
 Okay Frank..
 lol
 Yea, 3 hours of bowling would get boring :p
 lol
 Should of just got out the wii :p
 I have a wii
 So
 Has anyone ever tried this - http://www.pixlr.com/editor/
 Nope
 Lets design a website in that :-P
 Hey anyone know any php hosting websites that do allow proxy hosting
 Nope spirrwell, did you setup a website on Zymic to find you couldn't?
 spirrwell, im sure http://localhost/ would allow you too
 I don't see why it wouldn't.
 It's in the rules, you can't host proxies in zymic.
 Okay I'll try Pie
 it says the link is broken
 Rofl...
 Ah, just checking because we could clean it up, nice to know someone reads them :)
 What do you mean clean it up?
 What did you mean by clean it up?
 LOL
 Nice one, Pie`. ;)
 spirrwell: I'm guessing remove it :p
 Remove what?
 I guess I'm the mockery here :/
 spirrwell, I guess you could say that ;)
 I lol'd.
 http://www.zymic.com/forum/index.php?s=&showtopic=18215&view=findpost&p=97709 lol :p
 haha XD
 Interesting person you're trying to help on the forums, Brandon
 Why Alex?
 I have a suspicion it's not going to be that easy to get any coherent answer :p
 Perhaps :p
 I reckon he thinks he's already adequately explained the problem
 More than likely some people are like that, sadly ohwell I like a challenge.
 Oh ok be like that :(
 He may think his post got deleted or something haha
 Moved it?
 Yea
 You can leave a ghost topic behind if you're worried about that, then remove it later
 But that requires that you're organised ;)
 :P
 I'm not organised unforchuntly. You should look at my FTP's very messy :p
 I ought to sort that out well not anytime soon heh
 oh my...
 NSFW: Lady Gaga has a penis
 No she doesn't :/
 she does
 That's so fake.
 she is a hermaphrodite
 she admitted it..
 If shes has a penis them I'll be sick O_o
 its only a small one
 but she has one
 then*
 Proof? :p
 google it
 "lady gaga hermaphrodite"
 Ah, random sites on the Internet, all the proof you ever need
 Hah, freek of nature but I'm not convinced it's true :p
 freak*
 http://starrtrash.blogspot.com/2008/12/lady-ga-ga-admits-true-sex.html
 Just read that. Look how unprofessional the typing looks.
 "Good on you Gaga! We won't judge you at all."
 apart from al those men who fapped non-stop over her
 thinking she was a full on sexual female ;)
 Why would someone fap over her? :p
 a lot of people think shes super hot
 If you call this hot then you've got shit in your eyes; http://www.gossipcheck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/lady_gaga_01.jpg
 and how old is that?
 ;]
 people say shes like wine, gets better through age
 :p
 yep, shit in the eyes. looks like a mushroom
 :P
 http://www.zymic.com/forum/index.php?s=&showtopic=16614&view=findpost&p=97724 look at his sig no referral link but such a random link :-P
 SEO abuse most likely
 I see

 You see the mass amount of replys ?;
 :P*
 Saw this from a mile off, they post in as many threads as they can, then they just stick their link in their sigs afterwards
 http://grabup.crownstyles.com/24b91e51044ba836e84b327cb2d0941d.png < Makes you think hes a spammer of some kind :p

 Don't you just love that feature, Bread? :p
 I do Alex, I do :-P
 Hey, whenever I open a png image in Internet Explorer, it opens it up in quicktime?
 Because you're using windows.
 :p
 So
 I'll just remove quicktime
 Okay.
 that would be a mistake
 why?
 it's associated png with quicktime
 if you remove quicktime, it won't know what to open it with
 it's far better to re-associate
 xp?
 Vista
 Heh, I created more spam by putting them in trash can :-p

 I hate restarting my pc

 Nothing worked though
 Unplugged VGA and replugged, turned off and on, nothing
 Just kept going back to a black screen
 New bg yay
 wonder if WinUp will be able to capture this
 http://i38.tinypic.com/2w4xmvs.jpg
 Thats on the CRT
 Nice!
 Ok, fullscreen...
 Where did you get that background?
 well, here's my LCD
 http://i38.tinypic.com/2uejomd.jpg
 WinUp can only grab one screen at a time I guess
 Frank: I forget
 lol
 Its my desktop bg though
 outlet, do you have an ignore list for join messages?
 http://i34.tinypic.com/2i1z788.jpg
 TheOracle: I have that. :)
 Figures, you have a mac amirite?
 NO :o
 :o
 I want a Mac Mini or something
 I have a MacBook ;-) ï£¿
 but they don't have VGA ports
 so fail
 You can get a converter :p
 true
 more money wasted though
 don't see why they can stick one in there
 can't*
 Bass_Guitar, do you have an ignore list for join messages?
 Bass_Guitar means he's away asswipe
 TheOracle: No need for that :/
 with winup
 do i jsut hit printscreena
 and ti gets uploaded?
 No
 You do ctrl + alt + 2
 thats fullscreen
 How many times do you use a laptop with an external monitor? :/
 1 is selection i.e. pick somewhere
 3 an active window
 When I'm at home Bread
 Laptop + monitor
 FTW
 TheOracle but now he'll get the nick alert
 And will answer me eventually
 Well thats just too bad innit
 winup fails
 How
 it only screenied my primary monitor
 not both
 Thats what I said
 <TheOracle>WinUp can only grab one screen at a time I guess
 it can onyl di primary
 not one at a time
 Yes
 Great, I forgot what I was going to do
 Was fucking important too
 I just use a simple irc :P - http://i37.tinypic.com/do2p8h.jpg
 That Win7?
 No
 I prefer xchat with the tree view
 Vista

 XChat isn't simple
 lets see yours
 Its far more complex than Nettalk
 Bread?
 Just hiding some channels Frank 
 oh
 :o
 :D
 :o
 why?
 Cause they're secret.
 oh
 :P
 :O
 I should get pyD
 Everyone is bringing their bots here XD

 How many channels do you have to hide, Bread?
 I screwed up so starting again :P
 :/
 Frank: http://bread.uuuq.com/xchat.png

 yes
 but I much prefer mIRC ;)
 Yep, for Linux and Mac, and there's a free version from http://www.silverex.org, what version have you got Frank?
 Do you use mIRC Pie?
 Frank: Yes

 Bread, on linux I just did, sudo apt-get instal xchat :D

 Join #hosting
 Just leave it
 If no one replies talk to me and I'll do it
 Robert is helping him/her
 thanks guys
 Bread, my thoughts exactly
 I cant wait until the new version of zymic comes out, I think someone was saying that it has an account deleter
 just a little bit wierd
 I have like 14 host accounts
 Frank, I have 21 :-p
 lol
 I had 40? at some point
 lol
 Brandon: Might get one of these http://tinyurl.com/lbphdl or http://tinyurl.com/47ynys
 Ah, just 18 now
 haha, test accounts are evil.
 Omg
 When I go over the tiny url links they show me the normal links :D

 http://grabup.crownstyles.com/39c4c13f601c32ab7c49eceb72ceb65c.png
 ah, now that's a nice feature
 Hey, could I get www enabled?
 Yeah, which domain Frank?
 um, grab.uuuq.com
 Bread want to buy me it?
 FUCK SAKE
 I can't printscreen it working =[
 Rico: If you don't stop that I'm going to hurt you.
 !seen perry
 I don't know who perry is.
 Frank why?
 huh?
 it has nothing on it
 I'm still building it
 ben come on alienware dude
 lol
 what did i do brandon
 ??
 What's it going to be?
 I'm not sure yet :p
 really?
 I have an idea
 yeah
 what?
 I don't like it though
 lol
 well what is it?
 you are building something and dont know what its going to be
 lol
 the name suggests a file/photo uploading site
 yup
 And they're not allowed
 that is what I was gonna do first, but it wasnt allowed
 Rico: What you mean?
 Rico:	ben come on alienware dude
 why isn't it allowed ?
 alienware is a whole lotta crap
 file hosting isn't allowed
 Lol whats better?
 Specs look sick
 So now I dont know what I'm gonna do
 listen you can build a pc twice as fast for the same price ben
 Was debating that or a mac, then i saw the light and decided on alianware
 Yeh but i want that keyboard :(
 if you strap for cash go to V
 if you strap for cash go to http://www.falcon-nw.com/
 Oooh
 Rico, I live near them :D
 well sorta
 those guys are the sick ones
 about 100 miles from them
 hmmm Alianware FTW!! ;-)
 Robert, what should I do?
 Not a file upload site
 but it does not matter cause with all computer manufacturfers you just payin for bran
 maybe I'll just use it for my winup
 Bread, I dont need the www
 frank clearly it seems as tho you dont really have a reason to build a site
 are you board?
 yes 
 lol
 uhhhhhh i give up
 o u
 on u*
 Using it for winup is still file hosting Frank
 grrrr
 lol
 wat about the hosting you got from me?
 I just want something simple, grab.uuuq.com
 but now i cant :(
 well at least with me you can file host all you want and bread cant say nothing about it !!!
 lol
 Rico: Yes it does matter ;-)
 wats the difference ben
 Rico - there's no prices on their website
 that always worries me
 The Brand :D
 falcon ?
 They are really expensive
 Alianware
 you gotta configure the system to get a quote
 <Rico>if you strap for cash go to http://www.falcon-nw.com/
 falcon are miles ahead of alienware
 <Frank>They are really expensive
 yup
 And I know they are, cause I live about less than 100 miles from them, and I visted it
 those 2 comments don't follow each other
 well ben if you got cash buy falcon 
 Im broke lol
 then build a desktop 
 or buy dell xps
 Bread, you can just delete grab.uuuq.com since I cant do anything with it
 Nah I don't like desktops
 lol
 dell xps if for you then
 Or Alianware ;-) See I decided Im not going to pay Â£150 to fix my ps3 so just buy a Â£2,323 laptop instead :D

 Nice little feature there though Brandon

 No, that's Linkinus 2.0 well, the beta build.
 ic
 Private beta* :p
 Apprently we'll get a free copy rather than paying for it when they've fixed up all the bugs :-P
 We as in Mac peeps?
 whoa
 http://www.winupsite.co.uk/support/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=5 Not really NSFW, mebbe
 There is a forum :O

 winup has a forum :O
 Dur
 Is the Tetris logo of google meant to be readable?
 I thought you knew
 Nope Bread
 Just ghey
 even though I <3 tetris a bit
 :O
 Bread what?
 http://www.google.com Robert 
 Oh, are you meant to be able to see the word google in it?
 probably
 I've looked it from multiple perspectives and strain to see it
 Good to see my plugin's definately working correctly!
 Bread, the google tetris image sort of is
 Blue G
 red o
 yellow o
 blue g again
 yellow o with no hole
 green l
 red e with no hole
 red e
 its not PERFECT but
 its nto far off
 Now I've gone and got myself banned from crownstyles.com =[
 o.O doesnt sound good brandon
 Smooth
 get a proxy?
 lol
 Robert: I can't remember my password :-P
 ah
 so that's not the only problem then
 Nope
 Means now grabup wont work aswell :(
 I would like to echo Bread's sentiment ;)
 Not that he hasn't gotten himself blocked by certain server firewalls before :p
 Heh, just as bad as me Ed :-P
 Not quite, it wasn't because he forgot the password
 :(
 lol
 I need Sazzad.
 ;-)
 I attempted to go through a IP:PORT Proxie but never worked for me. =[
 i'm managing 16 e-mails and about 25 accounts, all different passwords and stuff, remember them all! and even some friends acount info :P 
 I changed my password like 3 days ago as I gave access to it for someone but then forgot it. :-P
 XD
 Brandon can I help?
 Ermm?
 Bread, he doesn't have root to su to
 Brandon, I'm guessing you can't change the password via shell ?
 You need to know the password to get on shell O_O
 XD
 thats what I thought
 Oh sorry, just read up, you've forgotten your password :-p
 ouch!
 That is abnormally large for a toaster.
 amai...
 You know those big ones you get in schools for mass amount of cooking? One of them :P
 An industrial toaster
 Just throw a sliced loaf in, and get toast out
 epic ^
 I could do with one fo them D: 
 :-P
 Yeah...
 I want toast now :(
 I wonder if they actually exist
 Alex: probablu
 Well, sure big toasters do, not sure whether having it sort out loaves into slices would be cost effective :p
 Alex: at ym dads workplace they have this machine thats got boread on like a constant loop
 bread *
 so theres alwasy fresh toast
 sort of like: http://www.bellecocooking.com/images/jt1.jpg
 Pie`: You okay?
 Brandon, jsut woke up
 my typing is poor 
 I noticed :p
 Which is not quite a cool as being able to just chuck a loaf in ;)
 and yeah, it is just past 3pm :p
 But just waking up aint a good enough excuse tbh :p
 it is when you've slept for 15 hours nearly
 ;)
 How can someone possibly do that.. :/
 Okay, Brandon, what you do is you lie down in a bed, close your eyes
 and dont open them again until you need to
 ^_^
 o.O
 And wake up in about 8 or 9 hours without any choice in the matter
 That's me anyway
 Well, arnt you clever :p
 Same Alex
 Well not so much 8/9 hours. I went bed like 4:30 or something and woke up just after 9 :p
 Well, that's because you went to bed at stupid o'clock
 XD
 I mean, if you weren't out last night why :p
 I'm not tired nor am I like ermm what's the word, lack of energy?
 If I'm coming back in around 3am or something maybe I'll go to bed around then
 Otherwise, I like my sleep :p
 Haha
 If I had it my way I wouldn't sleep
 I mean, if it was possible :p
 Now I need Tim :(
 aww :(
 using an xml package in php, how would I get the values from the following xml tag:  <object name="Crate" type="0" description="I wonder what's inside.">
 so like, how would I get the value of name ?
 What's the structure of the whole XML doc?
 <object name="Crate" type="1" description="I wonder what's inside.">
   <action>Search</action> 
   </object>
 but different object name's, types descritps etc
 You can grab tags by their name, so get all <object> nodes
 and different actions
 http://uk2.php.net/manual/en/domdocument.getelementsbytagname.php for example
 Would give you a DOMNodeList of every <object> tag
 getElementsByTagName("name"); would give me the value of the name tag inside <object> ?
 No
 It would give you a DOMNodeList of all the object tags
 Which you can then loop over to get to the DOMNode
 Hey you guys D:
 hey Brandon
 Something bad about OSX why have a screensaver if you can't see it? :/
 When screensaver starts the screen goes dark :p
 Oh, forget I even said that. :O!
 Why is there pop-up ads on here? - http://www.uuuq.com/404/index.html
 I didn't get any pop-up ads?
 Look at the source then, at the bottom
 I did
 I did too
 Oh I see.
 I have popups disabled :-P
 Oh, well its annoying
 So?
 Not like it matters, if you fully functional site then you wont get that, will you? :p
 I guess I'll just use .htaccess to fix it
 Wiihii
 Pie`, I build in my Angel Eyes on my scooter :)

 Okay now this is weird!
 What is weird?
 I'm using the old Linkinus and now when you posted a picture it's showing it when it never use to
 Normally would just show a link :-P
 Juw, that looks really homo ;)
 Pie`, well, it isn't pink right?
 :)
 Pink aint homo colour..
 Oh wait, what was the new colour
 purple or something?
 Yellow is more a girls colour :-P
 I'd say black is the emo colour, red is the crap colour and blue wins
 Yay, new Coda :D
 Juw: Black aint an emo colour for cars and bikes or anything just EMOs decide to wear lots of black and black makeup the big gayers. :p
 Wow that was easy... I basically bought this option on my phone for all day internet yesterday for Â£1, but when I pressed the back button in the browser of my phone it refreshed it and charged me twice, so I rung up orange, told them my issue, they're refunding me the extra pound and then I pushed for a refund of the charge of the call and I got that too :)
 Nice Bread! 
 Haha!
 Bread, black cars suck.
 Brandon*
 Brandon? :p .. Also, no they don't White & Black cares are win.
 cars*
 Well, they're not that bad.
 White cars with black tinted glasses are epic
 windows etc.
 Tinted glasses? You means windows yea? :
 :P*
 white ccars are bad because you can see the dirt on them
 so always look messy
 after youve driven them, no amtter how far
 It rains here all the time, so the dirt will get off easily over here :)
 Depends where you live and how dirty the streets are. UK seems pretty clean to me :p
 I agree, I was born there
 Lies..?
 I come there yearly, so ye.
 I'm not lying
 Brandon, depends where in the UK you are
 road qualities, etc.
 black cars have more accidents
 Like I said; Depends where you live and how dirty the streets are.
 statistical fact
 :S
 hardly authorative, but still http://www.viamichelin.co.uk/viamichelin/gbr/tpl/mag5/art20070801/htm/mobil-auto-accidents.htm
 You can't see black cars in the night
 Juw, thats what lights are for ;)
 so you can see them
 http://www.wisegeek.com/is-there-a-link-between-car-color-and-accidents.htm
 Black cars <3
 Pie`, black cars crash too often, the lights are usually broken
 Hummers in black are fine though
 of and Audi

 anybody knows if there are known problems with google indexing of uuuq? I was just told the reason my sites are indexed only to about 5% of total size could be a "bad neighborhood" situation. Is uuuq on any known "bad" lists anywhere as far as google is concerned?
 Updating the 13" MacBook today as well. Gets the new display, SD card slot and better battery life. Crap, they updated my laptop :(
 Who knows Java here?
 It wouldn't surprise me mater, we have a daily struggle keeping off all the SEO spam.
 my index dropped from about 20k indexed pages (out of average 50k) down to 600 during the last month. Then, during last few days it started to go up, and then stopped and seems to be going down again. Also, google bot basically stopped indexing the my uuuq sites as graph shows a drop of google bot activity down to basically 0 during the last week or so (there is a 1 week delay in what google shows about its bot)
 Adam :O
 Fuck sake, updated my macbook with firewire, sd and other stuff and added to macbook pro line..
 Bread, want to buy it?
 That takes the piss =[
 :p
 Going to give me the money for it Adam? ;-)
 Bread you can have mine I'm going to get the updated one.
 x'D
 But being fair they fixed everything I hated about my macbook, the dicks.
 Deal Brandon DEAL 
 lol
 Bread, so you think there IS a possibility like that? Actually, I could see that cause lots of kids to all sorts of stoopid stuff with "throw away domains" I guess. But are you aware of any facts on this matter and do you know where I can get more info on it?
 DO all sorts of ... you know what
 I'm really not sure mater
 ok, thanx anyway
 Bread, btw, how do you "keep off all the SEO spam" if it is not a big secret?
 Hey, there is a question in hosting "hey frank, can i make a social networking site like facebook using the free hosting?" so what do I say, I really want to answer this
 nevermind
 We watch the uploads mater
 and a few other tricks
 Bread, and what do those uploads tell you? I am not sure what kind of uploads you are talking about. Btw, I just did a huge upload of about 30k pages with latest version of mfcgoldmine
 you mean spam is somehow associated with uploading stuff?
 no, it's content
 Yup, they upload lots of pages with deep links, when you visit the page, it's pretty evident it's seo / mfa spam
 oh, I see, you mean upload TO zymic?
 that is prolly not that difficult to manage to see what kinda crap ppl upload to their site
 http://cache.gizmodo.com/assets/wwdc2009/wwdc2009-210.jpg
 Get safari ^
 Robert, you could prolly write a lil shell script that rings da bell when someone uploaded some stuff to his site and you can just go and take a peek :--}
 well, anyway, thanx for your time
 We do have a level of automation, but largely a lot is checked by hand, I can't really go into it.
 excuse me please can any one help me
 Sony are gay!

 Does anyone know how to speed up Internet Explorer?
 I don't need to buy my software, I use linux ;-)
 I had to move to FF cause it was slow
 I have bought xchat in the past though (for windows)
 Why would you 'choose' to use Internet Explorer? :/
 Heap of junk.
 +1
 I dont know, I've used it for years
 [19:25:37] <Frank> Does anyone know how to speed up Internet Explorer?
 unisntall windows + install linux
 then set up firefox to use a tmp fs
 Never tried Chrome
 I had them all installed before I reformatted
 I can't install Chrome *shakes fist*
 Though I'm VERY happy with Opera
 Who thinks I should try Chrome?
 Sure you can, Bread :p
 hehe :(
 Wine doesn't count Alex :-p
 Native install please
 Fair enough
 Sure you can, Bread :p
 Chromium Alex?
 no theres a developer version bread
 Oh dear, you're trying to make me repeat myself again ;)
 ^
 Oh, since when?
 Couple of days ago
 its been in development for ages
 Ooh, this I was unaware of.
 Since about the 5th
 svn?
 There're binary packages for Ubuntu and Debian I beleive
 Any links please? ;)
 chrome.google.com
 ?
 google.com/chrome?
 The linux version points to just a place to type an email address 
 http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel
 Thanks Alex, I was under the impression Chromium was the source, which just so happens to conveniently build on linux, but not completely functional.
 Still through chromium.org, but it's technically a pre-alpha developers only version of Chrome
 I just got through to a fit blonde woman on sony help line :D

 Deformed belly button imo.
 Heh, no they didn't Pie`

 Google Chrome doesn't seem to run badly at all, loads of broken bits, but the core seems to work nice. Unfortunately, the KDE window styling's are still around the window though.
 Alex, how long did it take you to create PasteSite?
 *nicely
 About a day
 Really?
 Cool
 Did you do all the php yourself?
 It uses pear's Text_Highlighter
 I did it ;-)
 Otherwise, yes
 alex did you get my email about pastesite?
 Haha : http://www.zymic.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=18270&hl=#

 Bread - deleted it, sorry
 about using themes for the color hightlight, such as twilight from textmate
 Alex "in a c**t your dull host will go Russians of find!!!"
 Oh, right, yeah, I forgot to reply to that honestly :p
 lol Bread
 I think alex's comment was @dronix Bread
 3 nick alerts in one, oh yeah!
 :P
 its cool
 There is a bit of that already, in that if you're on a paste
 You can switch it to a dark theme
 I'd like to see desert from vim
 The dark theme is stolen from vim basically :p
 I forget which one
 I think I sent you link to working example
 Yes, I was aware of that site anyways
 will uncooked potatoe kill u?
 no
 Why would you eat uncookied potatoes in the first place?
 cooked*
 Or cookied, sounds like a decent culinary technique to me
 cookied potatoes...
 sounds nice
 I'm not sure if it is cooked or not
 Well, eat a bit
 if it's REALLY hard
 it's uncooked
 Was cooking hash browns, put them in for another 5 mins just in case.
 Cookied potatoes, one to go along with the spaghetti bolognese burgers
 hehe

 Iphone new please? ;)
 *news
 new model iphone 3gs
 built in camera 3megapixels, can record video
 Cheers
 Heh, finally
 Proper bt support announced?
 iphone 3gs starts at $199 for 16gb
 BitTorrent? ;)
 not built in
 Yep BitTorrent Alex... BitTorrent 
 but theres a peer to peer support
 I meant bluetooth :-p
 Or it could also be BT the carrier ;)
 So basically, that was a very poor choice of acronym ;)
 yes thats supported bread, the iphone 3g starts at $99 8gb
 US prices aren't interesting to us :p
 With OBEX file transfer support though? I was under the impression it was just headsets
 alex I'm guessing its cheaper in the uk? no?
 there's also voice control built in
 Well, if you get a more expensive contract, yes
 Or more expensive if you get a less expensive contract

 god ill stop spamming now Ã­'m anoyying myself!
 Andrew: Server being slow for you?
 Like cPanel ?
 ftp
 hold on Brandon
 not bad for me
 @o down crownz.info
 Umm, apache being great brandon. Haven't been on cPanel or FTP yet, but I'll check
 It's up.
 but there again the servers like in my back yard
 Brandon: is that the server you're letting me use?
 crownz.info is up
 Pie`: yes
 FTP is perfect for me
 because about 10 minutes ago it wouldn't let me on my domain
 but it works now
 '<pyDelphi>It's up."
 I was asking if cPanel was slow not if its up or down xD
 o
 can't help you there
 cpanel only took 3 seconds to load, maybe less
 hmm
 yeah its was pretty snappy
 would be less but I loaded it from crownz.info:2082
 so none of the iamges were caches
 cached
 and my internet is slow, so for it to load that quick is good
 I have a question, is anyone here... sorry about my english I'm from Argentina
 move to #hosting please
 ask there
 ok, thanks
 "Your website at http://uuuq.com is back up.  The internet thanks you!"
 Where's that?
 Ah, uuuq.com is resolving
 but to a server page
 it's not your site
 yes, I only have email updates for uuuq.com
 figured if it goes down then mysite will too
 Not true in this case unfortunately
 what do you mean? my sites are redirected to that page as well
 no, you're asubdomains
 the subdomains are not up, therefore you site is not up
 Ah, yes, sorry
 You're right
 still, it's not YOUR site :p
 lol yes I know, not my fault they think it is

 I am not a twat!
 He didn't say all Americans were twats
 full of
 I'm not a twat
 Adam is a twat
 :p
 Adam likes twat*
 Meaning there are some who are not
 Frank needs to be careful who he calls a twat
 Adam> And everyone knows America is full of a bunch of twats.
 Frank. I did not mean it personally. Unlike your comment at calling me a twat.
 :p
 I'm off, back later

 Apology accepted.

 Dskaattinen*
 :O
 No, he's very generous
 He's just offered you cake
 strawberry cake
 No..
 Yikes, and coming from Brandon as well :p
 Yea ;-)
 I think the reason is too much time and general boreness
 getting a life would be a good solution
 Wait, instead of mentally challenged lets try fat because he seems very obsesive of food. Which means you can't say 'Yikes, and coming from Brandon as well :p' Alex :p
 But too late now =[
 no, I don't have any fetishes of food 
 :o
 Why not?
 you don't like any cakes, right?
 Only chocolate cake.
 Well, any cake tbh.
 Well, you could also go nuts if you have to use Win98
 I WANT CAKE!!!!! 
 I'm just a victim of it :(
 You're a victim of cake?
 Did the cake run away when you tried to nom nom nom?
 I'm victim of win98
 Really?  Now?

 hey andrew ive got a ? for you
 well, i would start to talk about pancakes again
 because anyone isn't alive here
 or really anyone is there a way to make an image hidden?
 what do you mean
 remove the image from the html code
 then its hidden
 i need to have an image on the webpage so that it goes into this scroll box but to put it on the scroll box it has to be in the post...
 well I know how to solve your problem
 1. go to the kitchen
 2. open your fridge
 3. take some pancakes
 4. send them to Brandon
 5. your problem is solved :)
 wtf..
 outlet|work: eh?
 I don't understand what you're wanting
 yeah me neither
 You want an image to be in a certain place, so why not just put the image there?
 My nose needs a good picking.
 Full to the brim with dirt.
 because the slider takes the iamge from the post
 The "slider"
 Can you give me an actual example of what you mean :p
 yeah like an image slider
 One like on www.brandonmcdonald.co.uk ?
 did you send those pancakes to Brandon?
 I've never understood that by the way, Brandon
 It doesn't seem like those should be the only two options :p
 Alex: Nor me :p
 I come away vaguely miffed by the whole affair ;)
 Yea, I was thinking that. Plus it shouldn't even be "Stranger or Devil" it's just ermm like the same thing hah
 Who's website is that?
 And no one wasy Brandon Mcdonalds
 are you Brandon madonald?
 Yes :-P
 Did you make that site?
 do you have pancakeas
 Yes? Well, Ruben made the slider for me :)
 I just did the images etc..
 Well, that's all it is 3 images haha
 you're weird
 Cheers :-P
 hmm I would go and take some sima

 How's the weather outside today? :)
 is he beggin for food again all the time alex?
 Wet
 I like this website
 http://www.thecreativedistrict.ie/
 Unlucky, Alex :p
 Me too
 Well, warm here 
 Not so surprising, for the north east of England :p
 what the.. I dont live in england :D
 No, I do
 I wish I was in a creative mood
 For a bit over half the year :p
 I prefer the winter
 The air conditioning was pumping out heat rather than lovely cool air not good tbh
 At workies.
 you wish a lot huh adam? :P
 Yes
 People here knew what I meant ;).  North England is definitely /not/ known for being warm :p
 Well, finland has something like hot summer and cold winter
 Continental weather
 Whereas we have maritime
 I hear people from finland sleep with their siblings?
 (yeah, I still remember some GCSE geography, go me ;))
 Adam, don't think so
 But I heard it
 we sleep alone
 Are you saying what I heard was a lie? :o
 yes he did :O
 probably yes if i really know what you mean
 Oh. Okay...
 Sorry for the confusion, must be some other country...
 eurovision \,,/
 finland's so good in it .D
 No
 Ireland have the most wins actually
 Agreed
 you don't sense any sarcasm? :D
 or irony? :D
 No sense no feeling
 You have won :p
 finland has just one win
 Which is better than some
 well, last time it was again zero points, what a surpris
 e
 well, I think the song from Norway was good
 i'm ashamed of my country, every year AGAIN big shame really T_T
 they should stay out of eurovision, serieusly
 where are u from
 you dun wanna know
 tell me, or i will start talking about pancakes
 From what I can see, there are something like 26 countries that have never won
 And most of those have never made it to the top 5
 So... finland aren't that bad :p
 XD
 well, finland made a world record of points but norway broke that :(
 UK has had the most top 5 finishes :p
 If only it actually meant something to do well at Eurovision
 but I think waldo's people wasn't bad if you compare it with some song from 80's
 only thing i like in summer is that you can't say it's night if you look out the window
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JSPh286spM how about that one?  That got us 0 points ;)
 They just aren't in tune through the whole thing :p

 ooh what was wrong with it?
 it wouldn't upload images
 it would only give you a space to type a url to an image
 Oh, the c ause?
 Because TinyMCE creators are greedy and wanted me to pay $40 for that funtionality
 So I found a tinymce plugin that did similar, and screwed around with that for 2 hours last night
 Ahah
 Bread
 Adam
 I bet you'd drive a slammed lexus if you could drive

 kick it tim!!
 w00t
 iPhone SDK 3.0 final is downloaded
 hm thats odd
 music played on windows is much poorer quality that ti is when played on ubuntu
 even though its the same song
 I find the opposite is true
 On windows its all dulled down and noisy
 but it's ebcause of my 5.1 surround sound setup that ubuntu doesn't take advantage of properly
 on ubuntu its crystal clear
 Pie` has to do with sound drivers, speakers, song quaility... a lot more than just 1 thing
 Probably your media player

 Bread Frank is back from jail!
 :|
 I'm so tired of that crap
 Yeah, he got back a day or so Andrew 
 I didn't even know.
 He said he went to help is grandparents :/
 frank is the food any good?
 bread I thought you were "showering" 
 You guys better shutup because I was never in prison - I'm so tired of this crap
 See, protesting it again, a true sign that he was...
 OMG
 I was Andrew, I finished :P
 Your a quick one aren't you
 Frank I imagine doesn't shower.
 10 mins?
 Yeah Bread, thats why my hair is a bit damp right now, I just got out of the shower
 They don't bring back harrowing memories Frank?
 rofl
 Bread, you better knock it off right now, I'm tired of this crap
 Just admit you went to prison then!
 I'm gonna start a rumor about you
 !k Bread stop bullying
 Sorry Adam, but we need to make him aware that to rehabilitate he must admit to him and his peers that he has done wrong.
 The first step is admiting.
 Bread you better stop I was never in prison. I'm tired of the crap you are saying about me
 Bread :( stop it
 if that's the story you want to stick to, so be it, but I along with most of the people in here know the truth. I'll drop it, but be it on your conscience...
 tututu, I cant leave a minute or prison break is on here? :O
 Frank why does it bug you so much that bread says you were in prison?
 nothing wrong with prison
 i was in prison on fathersday frank
 @Andrew, because I wasnt actually in prison
 And because I wasnt in prison - I dont enjoy bread saying that stuff
 jealous adam

 Weird

 is there a library for getting game info for cs:S servers and stuff like that

 hi guys, who i can talk to regarding phpAdmin issue?
 ???
 In #hosting you may Chade 
 Did you come via http://livechat.zymic.com?
 well i actually came through the official zymic website
 and i have a lil issue with my db
 Where on the main page did you find the mibbit link please?
 http://www.zymic.com/forum/ 
 top right corner 
 Chat in real time at irc.zymic.com this one?
 yeah ;)
 That links to livechat.zymic.com, or does it link to mibbit?
 Livechat here
 livechat here as well
 I don't mean to be rude, but why did you join general chat?
 We don't mind having you, we're just trying to streamline it and we need to find out why people are still joining here.
 When they have hosting questions
 well, i have been searching the forums for the last one and a half hrs, and this was my final resort
 Sorry, what I meant was why you clicked 'General chat' over 'Hosting chat'
 Don't worry, you're not the only one to do it
 well, it is my 1st time around this site, but i apologize for it :)
 nxt time i'll know
 Sorry, I'm not intending to flame, I'm just trying see if we can improve the way it is presented.
 i know man ;) i'm an IT Engineer myself and i know how those things work ;) user feedback!!! :P
 so dont worry at all ;) no offence taken ;)
 ooo murray is losing.
 hes poo
 Bad start in this first set
 dyeah
 He's held serve in the second one so far
 yay, a wild Tim appears :D
 :)
 Federa > Murry > Nadal :O
 Federer, Murray*
 watching paint dry > teniss
 lol
 IM OFF TO THE SHOPS
 There are much more boring sports than tennis
 Golf, Cricket
 I like the olympics :)
 Grand Prix isn't that exhilarating unless there's a crash
 Watch rally instead then :p
 Yeah, I like WRC
 Quite good for crashes
 Or car failure due to a bad knock
 I love how they jump out the car and just bash the car a log to fix it, then just drive on
 *lot
 They're being timed!  Can't go and fetch tools :p
 And they will continue even if they can't fix it
 So they'll carry on with a completely broken suspension or something :p
 Lies
 A slow time is preferable to not finishing usually
 Indeed, but it's still quite amusing to see them smacking their cars with an uprooted log
 that was beautiful
 Mr Stanly Fred wants to send me 30 million pounds!
 :o
 anyone here good at converting pages to a cms?
 he's on a roll now.
 who bread? he's a roll now

 now that is one classy lady
 Mark2, 
 She's so classy! She should teach at a Finishing School!
 - Shanna, Florida, USA, 29/6/2009 14:06
 Not from florida
 Unless originally from UK
 Nobody here says finishing school
 Unless they're talking about some small women's colleges mostly on the east coast
 It's mostly a swiss thing apparently, I've never heard it in real life
 lol
 Her nose O_o
 her bewbs
 G
 Fake
 ^
 her face is fake too
 Theyve been slated, but I love them, she said. 
 I had them done about six times over a year.
 Ive also had Botox on my forehead and around my eyes, and fillers in my nose-to-mouth laughter lines. 
 'I cant imagine not having Botox  its the best thing ever. My face looks better now than when I was 23.
 Explore more:
 Looks like it
 If that's her face at it's best I would hate to have seen her at her worst, frightful!
 - SW, Newcastle, 29/6/2009 14:10
 lol
 :)
 Very true, but I would point out, by reading a news article about her, you're sort of vindicating her opinion that she matters
 lol
 now I feel unclean
 ?
 did you wet your pants or something?
 Think I've just come up with the headline if Murray wins
 "It's a Murraycle!"
 lol
 That's awful, Bread, awful :p
 So yeah, perfect tabloid stuff
 Beat me to it ;)
 That is if they have room for Murray
 It might be another day of MJ in the tabloids
 The quality papers have moved on which is nice :p
 Oh dear
 They really are appalling stories as well
 A friend buys the mirror in my house, and I saw some of that on the day after it happened
 You need to disown them
 It was just page after page of random speculation, sensationalist commentary, and huge pictures
 The thing is, there's 10 people in the house :p
 I buy the Independent most days, and it gets read by about three people :p
 The Mirror gets read by about 6
 And this is a university
 Something is wrong with the world :p
 :P
 Could be worse of course
 It's not the Star, the Sun or the News of the World
 hmm.. client crashed
 All just as bad as each other :P
 Your fault Mark2, YOUR FAULT.
 Not really, the Mirror is just stupid :p
 The rest are even more shallow, and I know that may be an unimportant distinction given the scale
 But well, at least I have managed to stop the person who buys the Mirror from calling it a paper :p
 He now leaves saying he's going to buy his magazine
 there are more advertisments in that than actual articles
 I don't think what it has can be accused of being articles
 yawn
 I tried to think of a better word
 Drivel :p
 columns of shit?
 better
 I want to see that Dinosaur stage production
 Not heard anything about that
 But I'm not necessarily likely to :p
 If I've gone to someplace like that, it's usually to see stand-up, not a show
 pretty impressive what they can pull off
 I got asked if I wanted to see that, but faced with having Â£50 or seeing it, I chose the Â£50
 last one I saw was the stage production of Lord of the Rings, the stuff they managed to do was incredible
 Hah
 "Both players off to point Percy at the porcelain, and the fans keep themselves entertained with a rather weak Mexican Wave. Ian Hislop, for one, is not playing ball."
 This commentary is so weird at times
 5live?
 BBC live text
 Can't be bothered with the radio
 And I'm not allowed to watch the TV feed live :p
 Heh, so you can't go to http://www.tvcatchup.com?
 Any live TV, you need a TV license
 By law
 Otherwise I'd watch it on iPlayer ;P
 Should just use Jack's vpn :P
 Then again, that won't be in the UK
 So it won't work :p
 you don't need a TV license for iPlayer do you?
 You don't need it to watch on-demand stuff
 You do need it to watch live stuff
 ah I see
 how is that regulated?
 The TV licensing authority
 Basically the BBC's private police :p
 That assumes you're guilty until you pay them money
 how do they know you're watching live stuff on iPlayer without a TV license though? I know about a normal TV but...
 IM MAKING MORE COCKTAILS ANDREW
 Want one?
 Sure
 PLEASE Tim
 I need one, shit
 you're too young DarkKrai
 D:
 its lemon, lime, orange and pernod
 can I just have the first 3?
 Sounds good, never had pernod
 its like anacide
 however its spelt
 its French
 Bought this bottle in Paris
 little alcohole shop place in Montmarte
 They might not check, Mark2
  hey ?
 But I don't see not liking the law requiring a TV license as a good reason to break it
 And I'd rather not risk it in any case
 Hello Guest14939 
 If it comes to a vote, I will vote to see the TV license gone :p

 No one did "HI I'M BARRY SCOTT"?
 lol
 I just woke up and it is 4:16 pm
 I knew I should of asked for a bag ;)
 But yeah trying to clean this damn oven; nightmare.
 Yeah, and it's nasty the stuff that comes out
 Gooey stuff
 Yep
 Hey its better than cleaning the upstairs loo
 Which was worse than a pub toilet
 Probably
 Who has watched taken?
 Don't think people knew toilet brushes were invented
 That movie was kind of wrong
 thats just minging
 I doubt I could live like that
 I don't
 My bedroom is downstairs
 So I use that toilet
 lol
 But others well ... not sure how you can go sitting on something like that tbh
 Hopefully won't be too bad next year, we may only have two people in the house (nominally a 4 person house)
 :p
 Because the other two rooms are small and it's right at the end of the year.
 Two we've got are good sizes :p
 What ya gonna use the other small rooms for?
 A Brothel
 ?
 If they're unlocked, let people sleep there for the night :p
 Jack :o
 May as well make some rent
 It is on the edge of that kind of neighbourhood
 But no :P
 We had a taxi driver who worked at a swingers club in doncaster, and decided to tell us all about it
 That was weird
 Wierd
 :S
 this stuff is very dry
 unlicensed cab?
 No, rang up for it :p
 http://twitter.com/pcanella/status/2392596752
 Best part of it was this came about because he found out one of my housemates lived in doncaster
 Tim?
 Part way through he asked if he knew whereabouts the area was
 And said "we get a lot of couples coming to it, maybe recommend us to your parents"
 wtf... That is wierd
 Very peculiar man
 Swingers are; watch the Louis Theroux doc
 Mostly old fat men
 FFS
 So crimewatch got pushed to bbc2
 Why didn't someone tell me :(
 Damn tennis
 watching it atm
 hey Jack, what did you think of Brick?
 Didn't really enjoy it
 Don't like 'weird' films that much tbh
 Ahaha, the camera man is having fun 
 Tell you what though I watched Gran Torino the other night, very good film.
 brb
 yep, I really liked that
 I would like to congratulate DarkKrai and Cr`eme they've been in the same channel multiple times the past 14 or so hours and haven't fought.
 Thank You
 I am just ignoring
 lol
 was expecting Clint to go in guns blazing but it ended better the way it did I thought
 thats not really the point then
 lol
 Yeah fell nicely
 Will watch Dirty Harry tonight :p
 im watching Taken
 tonight*
 ITV1 have a Clint Eastwood thing at the moment
 That is on my list to watch Tim
 its good
 :)
 Taken's an awesome film, apart from Holly Valance bit...
 lol ^
 I think I've seen it
 Already hmmm
 0800 R E V E R S E
 back
 I've done that before Adam, it's a fun little task
 :)
 I do it with most websites now.
 Did it with new wized
 without the jquery ;)
 I can't remember, but I probably failed to not edit the xhtml. My process is normally to just code from top down. 
 I like html and xhtml the only things I can code
 A liittle php too
 and c++
 Did it with this earlier:
 http://labs.wized.net/looks/ccruise/preview/
 Cr`eme: ISO or C++/CLI or Visual
 I did it with
 Adam I like, but I feel the links at the bottom are too close to the bottom. 
 tmdvs.me
 cool, Tim
 I use Dev C++
 Alex ^
 That's an IDE, not really what I asked :p
 But from that I'll assume ISO
 lol
 I have made a tic tac toe 
 number averager
 Yeah, I did that once, few years back
 and many more
 In half an hour, just for the sake of it :p
 I am working on a bot
 Now
 I can't remember exactly why actually
 in c++
 A bot for what, IRC?
 Yes irc
 I never knwew it was possible
 What network lib are you using?  Boost?
 Wat do you mean 
 ISO C++ has no concept of networking in it
 You need a third-party library for that functionality
 Can you explain it to mee
 Cuz that is why my boit might have problems
 I love it
 when I have money again
 after not having any
 lol
 Adam
 Yes Cr`eme
 Thast was random
 So is the ` in your name, but you don't see me complaining
 lol
 to those watching Crimewatch: what is a 16 year old still doing out at 5:30 AM?
 That is not random
 It empisises the E if that is how you write empahaiseis

 narzy :D
 Dolleh
 :D
 POwer up!
 WOOHOO!
 voice is cool
 Hey Narzy
 Hello
 Are you at work?
 pool, gah always reminds me of my dad
 Oh?  Nothing wrong with a bit of pool :p
 neh, pool is fun :D
 my dad is like 89% pool and then 11% human :P
 Can't get that into pool
 Because if you get too good, then pool becomes a case of whoever pots first wins :p
 hehe XD
 Not too difficult if you're very good to fairly consistenly clear the table in a visit
 consistently*
 my dad owns a pub with this pool club innit atm
 so I figure out
 Ah, cool, wouldn't mind that :p
 i'm planning to "accidently" drop by with a bunch of friends... once..
 his site sucks, horror
 its worse then mine
 I would quite like a pool table in my house next year, but we'd have to get rid of the sofas.
 Almost worth it
 haha XD
 Yep, just sit on the pool table when friends are over
 The pool table at my dads pub gets sooo much money its crazy!
 Alex use one of the extra rooms if you have them, and if their unlocked
 haha, nice ben
 They're too small, and now taken :(
 hehe
 A pair of third years took 'em
 We've got the two big ones though, so no big deal
 Might make the bills a bit cheaper
 i'll nik a pic off his site rofl
 Whooo :)
 http://www.iaza.com/work/090701C/fuckoffdad18060.jpg TADA
 you aint get to see my dad :P
 Ah, nice
 Wow thats cool :)
 Similar size to the one I go to near uni
 My dads cheap he only has 1 pool table :( steal me one Dolleh?
 Not sure having the dart boards there is helpful :p
 Or is that room longer than it appears
 Dolleh this you http://www.typol.co.uk/Grabs/nVJmkY8M.png
 hokay :D i'll bring these for you mkey ben? :D my dad doesnt really need them anyway, the ****** :D
 Where's the oche?
 hehe ty Dolleh
 Close to the pool tables?
 lol, no that miss pothead
 i've never bin in there yet alex :P
 Heh, looks pretty nice.
 I'll stick to the uni deal though
 They open up the machines, so you can just reuse one 50p that falls through the machine
 And everyone who turns up pays £1 each for three hours of pool
 XD
 nice
 Yeah, fair bit cheaper than pubs :p
 Which are often £1/game
 The pool tables looks like the ones in rileys :p
 i'd like to go there, then by accidently ruin these damn tables :D
 haha why Dolleh?
 They look nice
 Oh =[
 Brandon you basket you deleted all my errors! :(
 XD
 I'm afraid damaging the tables is a foul in pool, Dolleh :(
 :o
 Also, smoking near them
 And some other things
 he has a special smoking part XD
 its ugly
 Well, these days it's illegal to smoke near them because that's an enclosed public space
 People have to smoke outside when at the pub here
 Same Ben
 Oh, yeah, not sure if netherlands does that
 The law sucks
 in here your allowed to build a smoker...cage rofl
 But it's also a foul by the rules of pool
 You smoke Brandon?
 "rokershok" lolz
 Nope
 I'm pleased smoking is banned in public places
 Pubs smell alright now mostly
 :-P
 Some pubs don't, but you just avoid those, they at least don't smell of smoke
 http://www.iaza.com/work/090701C/fuckoffdaddamnsmoker41448.jpg  smoking part
 Pubs do tend to have dedicated smoking areas
 But not anymore ofcourse :p
 They do now as well
 Dolleh leave the tap on there :)
 :o
 They tend to have a covered area outside
 I meant inside the pub
 Yeah, not inside obviously
 :)
 Old school.
 I would recommend you guys find out the world pool rules if you don't know them :p
 I find them better play than pub rules
 much difference?
 Um, well, a few main ones
 The set up of the balls in the triangle is slightly different
 You don't do lines, you do a tick
 After you've hit an on ball, any ball has to be potted or hit a cushion, otherwise it's a foul
 Ahh I see
 ('course potting the wrong colour, cue ball or the black out of turn would still be a foul)
 That rule stops annoying attempts at snookering you
 If the other player fouled when they snookered you it's a foul snooker
 And you can opt to switch colour for that turn or take the shot from behind the baulk
 OOoh cool
 On the first pot after the break, you choose which colour you want
 So if you pot a red off the break, you have to say either "red" or "yellow"
 Means you can choose the other colour if they've got better position on the board
 thats different
 And that's about all that comes to mind about the difference between world rules and pub rules
 wait, that snooker or pool?
 Pool
 gotcha
 :O my dads current GF is 10 years younger,  I SO KNEW IT
 And specifically, world rules black ball pool
 ahh women
 Ok Back
 9 pooltables? o.O geesh how does that fit underground? >_>
 Lol...mini size ones?
 no, http://www.iaza.com/work/090701C/fuckoffdad18060.jpg  that size
 No snooker tables then?
 im not sure
 Shame for a club to not have both
 snooker is shit
 If you're bad at it, yes ;)
 no it's just shit
 I'm gonna stick with my comment as well
 XD
 hmm not sure alex, I know he got dart shit, and 9 tables.. wtf kind of tables.. remains mystery
 dad plays snooker, pool, something else and darts
 Skittles, billiards, bar billiards?
 Those tables are sexy
 I dunno D: hmm time to go haunt that place :P
 my dad's nickname sucks :O
 You'd think, the amound of time I spend in pubs, that I'd be good at these sports.
 But unfortunately the pubs surrounding both places I live are the modern/up-market types without games :(
 `length jaxmthemirc_evon
 Length: 16
 how boring dave :(
 Up in York there are more pubs than days of the year inside the ring road, so I'm sure I can find something :p
 Plus a few snooker/pool clubs that I know of
 And there's pool, darts and skittles (though I don't play the last) at one of my two locals back home
 XD
 Hello
 I am back fully charged
 Went to sleep
 quick
 Yeah had a nap... but fully charged
 bbl
 BEN :O
 Dolleh Hi
 :(
 lol
 Waht is another ftp client like fillezilla
 ?
 Dolleh Ben = Banjo right?
 Yeah
 There's way too many. There's cuteFTP
 smartFTP
 Filezilla is the best to be honest
 in my opinion
 never mind itworked
 I like the live action software from fedora
 Forgot the name
 SmartFTP isn't free anymore :( I used to use smartFTP for years, until they went paid. I used to only have to deal with a nag screen, but now after the trial you can't use it anymore...
 oh pok
 ok
 you can always use terminal
 windows command prompt probably doesn't FTP and I wouldn't like it anyway :P
 ccrap
 Andrew: FileZilla ;)
 Reread the convo TheOracle 
 I already said it's the best
 and that I "used" to use smartFTP
 ah
 :P
 I think I got the frame working
 well lets see cr`eme
 Ok
 Let me upload and make a subdomain for ie
 ite
 it
 index50.html?
 no
 Wrong one
 Because that is stolen from bread
 ni
 I swear to balls i did not steal it from bread
 or outlet
 what?
 CHMOD'ing this directory sucks, it takes around a half an hour to do it completely :/
 link me to the file
 ok
 HOLD ON
 zymeta.co.cc/index50.html
 Lots of files I assume, TheOracle
 yep Alex
 no wrong one
 No, that's the one you stole
 Half an hour is still quite a long time though
 i never stole
 Sazzad give me the code
 god
 creme... not even a please?
 GEESH
 how rude
 I wouldnt give it to you either
 Ok
 Dolleh we know
 Cr`eme, hmm, seems to me like your are trying to mimic zymic
 oh waith, was that even a question? rofl
 grr
 uhoh, dun make the zymics angry :O
 creme, RUN
 Believe me, we're not threatened ;)
 I was growling at something else xD
 stupid putty crashed on meh
 XD
 oooooh
 I hate it
 It is all my fault
 omfg why won't this fucking thing work
 What is wrong TO?
 TO, kick it!!
 CREME thats MY & ben's nick for him
 STOP stealing it :(
 I call him seth
 theoracle is too hard to type
 indeed
 Yeah it is hard 
 so i either type seth or hit T then tab
 Gosh Dolleh
 WHUT
 well, the script that imports the images is being retarded and not seing any of the images in the directory :S
 That is better thanks andrew for the tip
 I didn't say you can call him seth, He doesn't like being called seth
 I'm fine with Seth
 never said I didn't like that
 I meant the tab t thing
 Andrew
 just that if I don't have nettalk open and somebody says Seth it doesn't alert me
 ok
 TheOracle: most clients let you add extra terms that highlight you
 If you want to add that in
 Nettalk doesn't
 Sure?  That's a bit deficient
 Yep.
 I'm pretty sure even mibbit has it :\
 Might be wrong though
 Well, I'm going to file a bug report to shove it up dem asses
 they are such pricks, they never respond in IRC
 Bugzilla, TheOracle?
 well the link is index50 but it sucks dick
 Yeh
 That has feature wishlists
 ahh you spook the hell of them
 No, no :S
 MediaWiki
 They have a bugzilla install though
 Do they check it?
 Yes
 like a religion
 Because that would be the logical way to do it
 Add a feature request on bugzilla
 they have a bot that tells them in IRC of new reports
 did yall see the frame I hate it
 It's something you can choose when submitting it
 Rather than a normal bug
 Alex: I'm not talking about nettalk
 no cr`eme no address
 http://zymeta.co.cc/index50.html
 Nettalk = IRC client 'm using; MediaWiki = bug I need to file
 I hate it
 TheOracle: it would help if you didn't switch subject randomly without any context :p
 :p
 me?
 ...
 He said TheOracle, are you TheOracle?
 Cr`eme, normally when someone puts a nick in front of the line, that means they are talking to that person only...
 No sorry
 If someone wants to talk to you they will say your nick.
 :(
 :(
 I fail

 I got this Vegetable pancake from the Korean restaurant and this shit is good
 XD

 Fuck yeah
 Blew out my mind
 DEpends, North or South Korea? :P

 Well, however it ends up
 It's probably still dog meat
 I didn't see any cops with guns in the restaurant

 Well, not in a veggie pancake, but korean dishes in general

 Anyone here knows xml?
 Am I ignored?
 Sure, it's fairly simple Sazzad|Busy
 You're going to be Cr`eme
 Ok so I need to write a statement. If the preceding sibling is even, I want it to float left
 I would think it would be something like this
 -_-
 <xsl:for-each select="content"><xsl:choose><xsl:when test="(count(xpath) mod 2) = 0"><style left></xsl:when><xsl:otherwise>different style</xsl:otherwise></xsl:choose></xsl:for-each>
 That'd be XSLT, not just XML :p
 Which I don't have much experience with, Bread is one to ask probably
 I am good at xml what is the problem?
 go six lines up cr`eme
 ok

 http://dznr.org/02cj  <-- all with apples private API drawing functions
 :(
 WHY HIDE THEN ï£¿
 lol
 Usually because the API isn't stable yet
 That's their normal excuse :p
 :p
 lol
 They're okay if you remeber to memory manage well and not to call anything to low level or close to the core springboard.app process
 heh
 At least, that's the excuse they used when a Firefox dev complained that Apple had hidden some functionlaity which would allow them to draw faster
 Which was being used in Safari
 Which is fair enough as long as it's true :p
 pfft
 To tell the truth
 http://i35.tinypic.com/317bk1d.jpg
 Apple devs don't like webkit
 They love it but like the ugly child
 It has serveral major memory leaks
 thus they dont use true webkit on iPhone
 yet the API they give to iphone devs is true webkit
 :o
 causing apps to lag/crahs and leak
 cool
 hmm
 evil Apple lol
 Woah.
 Their view API has alot of redraw methods called
 so apple just uses emtpy image view
 I bet Adam and Tim have great big alarms which go off when a new person follows them on Twitter.

 Hi CSS_Guru

 yes, im pretty good Andrew, how are you today?
 Tired, but good
 get some coffee
 Be back in about 15 minutes
 lots of sugar please
 :)
 eww sugar
 I'm sweet enough
 omi!
 I successfully made a website comment system
 You figured it out?
 yup
 I still dont get the while () startements use
 why can't it just be called loop()?
 It's basically expressed by the name
 It's a loop that runs WHILE the boolean condition in the brackets remains true
 And when it is no longer true, the loop ends.
 oo :O now I sorta get it
 Put 3G on
 I see, different IP
 :D
 ICUP lolll
 Yup
 Man I miss elementary school :\
 So much more fun, no worries
 Orly? Lol
 I don't
 I love not having school
 That is one thing though, I'm glad I'm out of school
 I hated school, and our school system sucks in Florida, worse than the rest of the US which isn't all that good
 guys, what should I have as my protection from everything, I do have htmlspecialchars wrapping my POST strings
 That's sufficient for outputting
 well, the user enters data
 Everything should be validated before it is accepted
 And then depending on what you do with it you might also need to sanitise it
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4zK1YC6XCs&feature=player_embedded
 lol
 YouTube - Norton Antivirus Fail -- Rated 4.5 Stars
 htmlspecialchars() sanitises data to be output as a part of a HTML document
 mysql_real_escape_string() sanitises data to be used in a MySQL query
 The sanitisation functions are use-specific, but validation is fairly universal
 so I cant do (mysql_real_escape_string(htmlspecialchars($string))) ?
 You could, then you'd have a string which could be stored in a database which is already safe for output
 But I'd question why you would
 I prefer to consistently sanitise as and when needed, rather than trying to pre-empt it in advance
 id add a strip_tags in too
 just for security for everything
 Because trying to do it that way means you can think something has been sanitised, and output it, when actually it hasn't
 http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/fail-owned-sheep-sale-fail.jpg?w=500&h=332 < Aimed at the welsh :-p
 It's clearer to do it the slightly more long-winded way :p
 :)
 Or New Zealanders
 not sure what you mean Alex, Im still a php noob.
 what should I use to secure user input, into my database
 When putting something into a query, use mysql_real_escape_string()
 Then, when you take the data back out, and want to output it, I'd strip_tags and htmlspecialchars it then
 so thats all I need?
 Hello.
 mysql_real_escape_string() is all you need for securing input into the queries
 oK ill do it, thank you Alex.
 And the others are for preventing XSS at the output stage
 I appreciate ALL who's been helping me with PHP for the last w days. I thank you all for having the patience with a php noob like me.
 :)
 Btw, I need a bit of help with PHP too.
 In which case ask (here or in #php)
 Okay.
 I want to write a value into a MySQL database that is stored on my computer.
 back
 i've being stealing :(
 bad dolleh, bad bad bad
 The problem is that every time I try to run the php script

 on line 17
 A voice?
 Dolleh: stealing what?  Are we talking sauce packets from restaurants, or cars?
 Skippy: ok, pastesite the relevant code
 drinks :(
 Yay!

 congrats :O
 Thank you
 where did you steal it frank? ;)
 Dolleh ---> http://grabs.uni.cc/BRZ2ZxAsgkAErNA.png
 Stealing drinks?  From who
 :O
 There was only one line of code that had the problem
 so I just pastesited the script:
 from somebody i dunno alex :(
 Skippy: it may be on that line, or the mistake might be on the previous line of code
 http://pastesite.com/8445
 Ojh
 Oh
 It's parse error on line 16, acually
 you need to put the characters inside quotes
 Oh.
 Usually that's just a notice
 $q1 = md5($_POST['q1'] . 74aBrQsT1P);
  turns into $q1 = md5($_POST['q1'] . '74aBrQsT1P');
 I thought that was only for variables/
 for any string
 It could be that, but the PHP parser usually works around that mistake
 Oops
 skippy try it on line 16 only
 if the error changes to line 17 then that's your problem
 Ah, sorry, but it won't given the string starts with a 74
 So yeah, that will need quotes.
 Starts of thinking it's an integer, then the parse error comes on the 'a' character
 off*
 Okay
 So I will try it now.
 It worked really well!
 Thank you very much.
 I need some more help now.
 This time, it's not for parse errors.
 -_-
 Never mind.

 http://trippin.uni.cc/grabs/WdUFxtjf.png
 LOUDY and windy
 I hate that that thing gets cut off
 for clean cuts like that, I would use a jpg
 ... that's a screenshot of my desktop
 http://trippin.uni.cc/grabs/5jznVhvl.png
 eww vista
 get windows 7
 no dont
 ... it IS windows 7
 its got big security flaws
 get linux
 its win (Y)
 Pie`, shhh. We've already heard your complaints
 Windows 7 is really hard to hack actually
 even hacking it yourself is hard
 CSS_Guru: Someone australian made a program to launch applications as administrator without UAC asking
 ++ released soruce code with it
 microsoft sa they arent going to repair it
 Linux is really crappy, when it comes to developing
 CSS_Guru, r u srs ?
 yes
 /join #OSwars
 its the BEST os for developemtn
 development *
 ok im off the sunject
 subject*
 CSS_Guru, I am running win7 though http://trippin.uni.cc/grabs/x1KqxG18.png
 most people buy Linux ** oo wait, linux is free LOL
 its open source too
 its the best OS out there
 has the best apps
 uses the elast amount fo system resources
 Pie`lets drop it...
 ^
 You're just going to cause people to get angry
 No more OS wars :'(
 I'm sorry, hes just laughing at the fact hes jsut proved himself wrong ;)
 Each OS has its benefits and drawbacks... leave it at that.
 Linux doesnt have support for any Adobe product, or Microsoft product like Word , so FAIL
 http://cdm419.uuuq.com/?page_id=42
 http://cdm419.uuuq.com/?page_id=42
 CSS_Guru: Open office, GIMP
 open office and GIMP suck
 It does have support of several adobe products
 Fatal error: Call to undefined function gzinflate() in /www/uuuq.com/c/d/m/cdm419/htdocs/wp-content/themes/black_pc_gaming_computer_tee05/functions.php on line 740
 Flash player
 near the bottom
 You can run most versions of Photoshop satisfactorily as well (just CS3 has significant issues)
 http://cdm419.uuuq.com/?page_id=42
 But Photoshop god quite bad after cs2 imo
 its too bloated
 I wish CS3 would work, I would consider switching to cs3
 switch to linux*
 what extra is there in cs3 that cs2 doesnt have?
 the fact that I don't have cs2
 CS4 is the best for photoshop
 cs4 was rubbish
 que da error ?
 CS4 works fine
 its bloated
 As does CS2 and under
 takes like an hour to install
 for an image editing program, I want 0% pixelation, which is what I get with photoshop cs4
 and you need to close firefox to install cs4
 uh
 wtf is with that?
 gimp is 50% pixelation
 0 pixelation is impossible
 You need to close firefox to install any adobe product
 since every image is bitmap ;)
 nto cs2
 except for svg
 or at least, i didn't.
 I did
 I mean , smaller pixels
 you can't see squares
 That is rather stupid, having to close firefox to install my image editor
 I don't see the point in that
 So zoom out
 its not even like it needs to change anything in firefox
 or get any properties
 I could understand for installing adobe reader, because it has a firefox plugin, but other than that... no
 and Flash player
 i dont use reader though, I use Foxit Reader
 It's tiny and fast
 I use Open office document writer :D
 Pie, what if you change the image size to a bigger size, in Gimp you get pixelation, but cs4 you dont
 you should do
 well get a little blurry
 GIMP is excellent
 because all you're doing when making an iamge "bigger" is stretching the pixels
 I use it every day, no "pixelation" as you call it
 so it has to guess what is there
 and try to fill it in
 linux was made for third world countries, keep that in mind...
 Oh shoot, brb forgot to do the dishes :(
 so itd probably look shittier as photoshop will have guessed what heeds to be there
 CSS_Guru: that's just misinformation
 CSS_Guru: HAHAHAHA ?
 pfft
 linux is for people who cant afford a real OS
 At least know a little about what you're talking about :p
 CSS_Guru: linux is for real people
 It's not about cost at all
 by OS I mean a platform that upgrades periodically, not every year
 The point of Linux is freedom, in the sense of freedom you have to alter anything in the OS, not free in terms of cost
 CSS_Guru, linux system upgrades like 3x a week
 windows only every tuesday
 I hack Linux, not Windows...
 orly, how does this "hacking"  go ?
 i can easily hack a WEP with Linux Ubuntu
 nono, you hack stuff WITH linux
 you dont hack linux
 theres a difference
 I wouldn't say you 'hack' a wep key either, it's cracking.
 not really
 yes acctually CSS_Guru
 WEP is broken anyway
 if you were "hacking" linux, you would be doing stuff to the system
 lol man oo man
 breaking ti or manipulating it to your needs
 not trying to crack a WEP key
 yuo ppl gang up on me for talking about a weird OS
 and that can be done jsut as easily from windows
 witht he apropriate tools
 pie I could do everything the same, except of the resolution :P
 wat
 my linux reslution had to be 800#600
 800X600*
 that's your graphics drivers
 not linux's fault
 ubuntu is running 2960x1050 for me
 dual monitors
 because Nvidia is sexy <3
 well, Im at 1024X800 on Windows XP
 Everything I can do on linux I've done on windows before
 and vice versda
 versa *
 I see a big flaw
 CSS_Guru: what is that ?
 The resolution I use in Windows Xp, I dont get on Linux
 thats again; your graphics drivers
 not linux's problem
 what graphics card do you have?
 It is linux's problem
 its not, linux dont make the drivers
 they jsut distribute them
 they acctually say when installing them that is is not free software
 they're jsut distributing it
 Well they make some of them, but nvidia/ati provide theirs separately
 Nvidia > ati imo
 What should I do?
 smack PS around a bit
 Hey all
 o.o
 :O Meeso's sister?
 frank I would run cmd.exe - use 'cd' to get to the directory php is in. then type "php /location/to/.php/file"
 hmmmm, wont work
 Should I try re-installing PHP?
 Do what Dave said
 I tried, it just gave me an error :|
 which error?
 http://grabs.uni.cc/ogPZF4QW3v.png
 Oh right, well try php.exe -f hostingbot.php
 I'm re-installing it now
 Still doesnt work :|
 I've also heard you can run it off your hosting, I have hosting other than Zymic how would I go to do so?
 you have ssh?
 you cant on SiteFrost, Frank 
 Brandon doesnt allow it either
 You didn't do it right Franks
 *franks
 :|
 You missed the 'php' command
 What do you mean
 you need to type: PHP [space] /FILE/DIRECTORY
 You got that error becuase you supplied no command
 I'm trying to open the php file with php.exe I've got it to work before
 I'm trying to teach you the proper way to do it
 Ok
 Nevermind, got to go out anyway.
 I believe I do Bread
 http://grabs.uni.cc/pWhnUkEP7g.png
 I may be wrong though
 If DarkKrai says your host doesn't allow you to run bots, he's probably right
 few do
 I still want to see
 Frank, youre still on sitefrost
 ?
 Yes
 oh
 dont use it
 its against their TOS, definately
 Dang, then I cant run my bot :(
 run it locally
 thats what I do
 I run a server on my computer
 I cant get it to work
 xampp
 install it
 I want it to run on IRC
 get apache running
 then move the php file to htdocs
 then open it in my browser
 and then it runs :D
 ok
 Will wamp work?
 Can someone screenprint http://www.regnow.com/softsell/nph-softsell.cgi?item=22401-1
 after clicking order button
 e.g. the next page
 thanks
 xampp is better
 its easy to use
 and works
 I guess I'll use xampp then
 kais
 Be back in about 15-20 minutes
 Bye bye all.. back later

 im, okayihs to, and good to hear your good
 your logic is flawed
 Gayso: Nothing nice to say, shut the fuck up ^_^
 mu bad
 =/
 Everyone will get banned
 uhoh, jack saw it :O
 Even Bread!
 yur all busted now!
 :o
 I recommend.. HIDE
 I like how the tables are turned
 nice
 What did I miss?
 sazzad, HIDE
 How do I hide?
 just HIDE!
 type /me hide
 =/
 I know...but no where to hide
 hide in the closet
 Come with me and Dolleh!
 hide behind jack, he wont look there :D
 I would've been happy to leave that one, Ben
 :O Brandon!
 ?
 Alex ?
 If it does happen again tell me, I'll add it to the list of disallowed nicks
 Oh the rape
 Thought the rape one was a joke thing Andrew did the other day my bad :(
 wot happened
 Ben??
 I don't know where it came from to be honest :p
 I just kind of assumed that if a ban was there for that nick, that someone had used it
 what happened :S
 hide
 Oh yeh i think Andrew did the other day, but don't recall someone called rape.
 We're all hiding from someone/something
 Brandon: Sazzad wants me!
 No
 lol
 ?S :/
 I mean what Alex and Ben are talking about
 I'm still not entirely sure myself
 - Ben set mode: -b rape!*@*
 lol
 That yeh?
 Well yes, but I'm not sure why the ban was there in the first place :p
 Either that or DarkKrai and Creme arguing!
 Same :S
 I had assumed someone had used the nick, and so got banned
 Ahh ok sorry my bad, i thought it was Andrew joking.
 In which case I was saying if someone does come on with something that inappropriate, I can make the server not accept that nick
 Oooh superadmin?
 Two ways I could do it
 I'd rather add it to the unrealircd.conf so it's permanent
 Oh ok cool! Dolleh Alex has lots of powers :O
 omg :O
 waht?
 what*
 http://www.google.co.uk/firefox?client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official
 What's happened to the 'Start' text
 Who decided to desaturate it :|
 Different colour ?
 I haven't used FireFox in ages, been using chrome so can't remember what it looked like.
 rebel where have you been! Long time no see.
 Pretty sure it wasn't like that
 The new Firefox screwed up our software real bad...I'm angry
 my granfather died 
 Sorry to hear rebel
 rebel: May he rest in peace
 Sazzad: That the one you posted on zymic?
 Sorry rebel
 Sorry to hear rebel.
 Jorsek
 yup
 sorry to hear rebel :3
 Kevin been on?
 nope
 Aparently they did a major upgrade to some features which took down our softwares functions
 fucker
 Hi andrew
 Main thing they've changed that I can think of
 Hi Cr`eme 
 Sazzad: Can't you just re-code the fucntions?
 Would be adding HTML5/CSS3 functionality, and the TraceMonkey JS engine
 There's over a thousand of pages
 'course, they added <video> with OGG-Theora support for it
 hey andrew
 oh haha maybe not that easy then.
 Hey Dolleh l
 :)
 And then just a few days later video codec support is removed from the HTML5 draft standard
 Andrew :D
 Good god i'm popular today hey TheOracle 
 rofl
 Because Apple won't implement Theora and the rest can't afford H.264
 fans!!!
 We're probably going to spend a week or two modifying our system
 Or won't due to freedom concerns
 Which means a longer delay on the other work we have left to do
 When were you planning to release Sazzad?
 Oh it's launched. We have many companies using them already
 Oh cool, link? cba to search forum.
 Oh Sazzad! I thought you were some random person xD
 new nicks confuse me imensly
 Well I can't as most of the sites are confidential. And the demo wont work on any browsers except FIrefox 3
 Oh ok :(
 Actually hold on
 Hey Tim
 PM, please? :o
 :(

 A friend just texted me (owner of ourdiggs, that site i make... you know?) well, he just said: "Just went around the ring in a rented sirocco coupe! Passed 4 porshce an R8 and a load of other race cars lol get the c30 out here" haha He is in Germany at the nurburgring
 To use the colloquial
 Jealous.
 ah okay
 bbs, going to eat
 Nice :p
 When does it close up for the public, there's the german F1 race there on sunday isn't there?
 Really? I think it's next week.
 Yeah it's next week.
 Yeah, it is
 Knew it was a sunday, but got the wrong one :p
 Is apart of the track the nurburgring?
 It is the nurburgring isn't it?
 The nurburgring is massive I thought?
 There is two circuits.
 The F1 one
 which is 5.1km
 and the other which is 20km
 I liek germany, if you got a car, as dutch person, you can just drive as fast as you want, cause the police of germany is 98% of the time too lazy to send the tickets to you :P = win!
 Ah, still, the whole F1 course is on there :p
 Or... is it because the main roads in Dolleh have no speed limit?
 Some of them do
 Yes, the Autobahn

 XD
 :O it was from Dolleh
 SHHT :O
 it wasnt me
 im innoccent
 Tim, any reason you're using DOM over simplexml?
 so the first node in the item node is the media node?
 Yeah its a LifeStream thus many URL's some HTML some XML
 node six bread
 Damn it
 Someone called me :O
 :O
 Lol Lol Lol

 Oh my bad, thought you was into that stuff :(
 rofl
 Aslong as you stop sending me pics...
 LMAO
 I haven't worked with namespaces in XML since thebreadbin :P

 Oh that's easy in xpath //media::thumbnail@urr see what that returns Tim
 lol no xpath function on this server wtf
 boo
 new DOMXPath?
 I thought it was part of  DOM
 http://www.php.net/manual/en/domxpath.construct.php
 then we use evaluate I take it bread?
 Erm depends what you want it to return, query for a DOMNodelist, evaluate for them as strings
 oh wow you can just execute a xpath expression
 is there a ctcp command for getting all user modes on a certain nick?
 so like if you did this mystical command on me you would get back +ixr
 /media:thumbnail@url   is an invalid expression :s
 media::thumbnail
 You can extract it from whois Pie` 
 I know
 but is there a command which gives you JUST the user modes ?
 Not that I know of, Alex might know
 ed "media::thumbnail/@url" is an invalid expression
 -/
 Try removing / before @

 Brandon: Bread hello:-P
 Afternoon
 !translate off Brandon
 Bonjour
 :)
 Just had a meeting with the guy I used to work with
 First time I've had a porshe parked on our drive :P
 :-P
 What was the meeting about?
 Building a website / Helping fix one of his friend's laptop
 I might have some design work if you're interested
 :)
 What's wrong with the laptop?
 He was wearing a Â£5k Cartier watch o_O
 :O
 Nice
 It came up with an error about a missing system32/config/system file Brandon 
 Uh, oh :-P
 Fix it?
 porshe... cartier watch.. is he married yet? ;)
 :-p
 Press r for recovery... so I did that, nice black screen... found a guide on what to do from laptop... tried fixing with linux but he had a 16GB pendrive that fooked it up, silly security software.
 when we are married hell have better car(s)
 Uhm, it's doing a chkdsk atm
 Yep Dolleh, he's about 45 - 50
 ahww damn D: sad case D:
 Ah cool :)
 Taking FOREVER to finish though
 Been running for over 1hr30mins
 I hope it's not the disk drive that's corrupt.
 O_o
 Might be getting a free laptop too :P
 How so? :P
 :O always nice
 Freebies <3
 He's going to Saudi Arabia to pick up 6 or so old ones to scrap, about a year or so old, he said if they're any copy I can have one :D

 TypeError: connect() takes exactly 2 arguments (3 given)

 I need better icons!
 http://clients.crownstyles.com/24hDesign/

 Maybe wrong colour for buttons.

 Hmm icons where?
 Why not just have a little white man for My Account?
 hm
 i ended my explorer.exe process
 and nwo it won't start
 :S
 when i try and start a new explorer process
 Bread for the big buttons :p
 it just opens my documents
 Refresh, I changed colour for the buttons :p
 Much cleaner.
 Ah I see now
 I like those icons
 Me too
 But the Writing one :(
 Should have my nick as;
 maybe a pencil?
 xD
 Maybe
 I've got 5 hours to completei
 it
 my mom has this beautiful fountain pen :O an icon in that style would look awesome :O
 Refresh :-P

 Now I have ... blank space which I'm not sure what I can fill up their :p
 I liked the rainbow image
 maybe just make it a bit skinnier under the need the nav
 ever heard of dezignus brandon?
 http://clients.crownstyles.com/24hDesign/ hmm? ... Yea, maybe. I don't think the rainbow will work.
 I don't even think their logo will work with my design so far x'D
  http://grabup.crownstyles.com/91a545f2b14dff7bcd9a9945b1213b19.png < Their logo.
 How about this Bread http://clients.crownstyles.com/24hDesign/ .. less space :-p
 Uh, oh. Problem with padding their :p
 What's different?
 Smaller?

 Keep getting invalid syntax but I can't find it :S
 TheOracle: I'd say lines 37 - 39
 Needs indenting
 or is it not part of the de?
 *def
 its not part o the def
 Should put it a new line after it :P
 What's the error?
 @reload ai
 SyntaxError: invalid syntax (source unknown)
 ^
 no lines?
 ?
 Numbers
 oh I dunno
 Line numbers where the syntax is wrong
 I could never figure out how it reports errors
 Is it an exception?
 I dunno :/
 hold on

 Can you pastesite pickleai please
 its in Binary, so you won't be able to read much
 check lines 1-84
 Theres only three lines
 http://pastesite.com/8533
 http://i37.tinypic.com/34g33ew.jpg
 if you find the answer memo it to TheOracle, I g2g
 thanks :D
 pickeai doesn't look very python'y, you're trying to import an ai module from it
 Come on Jack, you've got to say who you reckon now :p

 Eww TheOracle
 Good song.
 Now Im pissed off
 the silent button has dropped off my iphone
 Cant find it
 its stuck in silent
 Hahah.
 I need to turn it on and off silent during the day at work too
 This sucks balls
 Bread: Thanks, got it workin
 Looks like you have to buy a new one.
 What was the problem in the end TheOracle?
 BRandon I dont have the money
 That with "from pickleai import ai"
 python tried to interpret it as a python file
 even though its just a pickled dictionary
 Ah I was right ^_^
 Now I have a method of unpickling the ai{} every time after the ai.py is loaded
 pkl_file = open('pickleai.py', 'r')
 ai = pickle.load(pkl_file)
 pkl_file.close()
 the pickled ai{} is unpickled and restored to ai{}
 :D
 :)

 afternoon andrew
 afternoon
 Hi Andrew
 I start my new job tomorrow, i'm nervous :\
 :O
 what job
 My new job :)
 which is?
 My gimp
 McDonalds?
 I'm working for a company called Alorica, They got Costco as a client, we take all their customer service calls for all the electronics they sell. If anything is wrong I troubleshoot with them and try to fix it, if it's something serious I have to then contact the manufacturer of the product. (I'm not sure if I"m contacting the manufacturer for a replacement, or for a service call)
 hehe
 I start my training tomorrow, 9am-6pm for two weeks, and then the third week I take live calls with someone watching over me, but it'll be an evening shift.
 Full time at $10/hr
 :O
 We will miss you Andrew
 congrats andrew :D
 hour lunch?
 I work inside the local Sony building, I'm still not sure if my job has anything to do with sony or not though
 It's probably an hour for my training, but normally only 30 minutes
 ah k
 I have to get there 15-20 minutes early tomorrow to get my picture taken for an ID badge.
 They are a "secure" building. They have a guard lol
 lol
 haha
 XD
 haha wow, this is an excerpt from the sony blog
 Ft. Myers is the home of our customer support operations for consumers in the U.S., Canada and Latin America. In addition to technicians located there to answer your calls and e-mails about our products, it is the hub for Sony support offered to consumers from technical experts located around the world from San Diego and Brazil to the Philippines and India.
 I didn't know our sony building was such a big deal
 I thought they had hundreds of sony customer support centers in the US
 apparently ours is a big deal
 It's a huge building though, two stories
 wow
 my friends cat is hilarious!   http://i416.photobucket.com/albums/pp249/Bibabuzimann/fotos/IMG_6211.jpg

 This is the sony building that i'll be working in: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_CISC there are two pictures of the outside, but not the best images since there are tons of trees around it
 :O
 :O
 if i need tech support can i have a direct line to you?
 XD
 Depends if you bought your product from Costco or not, and as for direct line I doubt it
 Apparently from what the interviewing lady told us, that location gets around 2000 calls and hour
 I think that's what she said
 Andrew: I start my job tomorrow :D
 Where at Brandon|Busy 
 Acer ofcourse. :-P
 Noice, maybe we can send each other electronics xD

 How do you do something like this - file.php?page=contact
 php frank 
 $_GET['page'];
 !google php navigation
 www.google.com/search?q=php+navigation
 http://www.alistapart.com/articles/keepingcurrent/ 7 Nov 2003  The offspring of this marriage will be a single navigational document called navigation.php . Using PHP, we will include our 
 ok
 if($_GET['page'] == "contact") { include contact.php; }
 Could also modify that so that you don't have to create a new line for each page you make
 How would I go to do that, I'm not good with PHP
 haha tim your iphones stuck in silent?
 yup switch($_GET['page']) {  case contact: idjaidja break; }
 Yes outlet
 your brothers a jerk
 breaking your ipod touhc
 yup
 no tim that's not what I was thinking
 I hate him as it is
 but I just looked at my old code and realize it won't work anymore
 if (! file_exists("$x.php")) { include("news/news.php"); }
 else{ include("$x.php"); }
 Andrew: ^ That's vulnerable to XSS injection
 i herd
 yea I don't care
 not how I do it anymore
 me either
 that's how I did it 5 years ago
 I just use a header and footer file now
 I just have <?php include("top.php"); ?>
 (content here
 )
 Looks better than file.php?page=contact
 <?php include("bottom.php"); ?>
 add some sexy mod_rewrite and you're good to go
 why? D:
 index.php looks worse than /home
 http://www.tmdvs.me/page/contact  <-- mod rewrite
 is that like
 index.php?page=contact?
 yeah
 ic
 bah wtf is up wth my explorer
 i ended it like 3 hours ago cuz it was usin 50% cpu
 now when i try to make a new process it jsut opens my docs
 because it's probably still open
 if you run explorer.exe and it's already open, it just opens your docs
 ah yes
 XD
 but I closed it :S
 thats why start bar disappeared
 and enver came back
 crashed again?
 Get windows7 
 :)
 windows 7 = major fail ;_)
 I've only got xp installed because of when i want to game/do windwos only stuff
 Pie`, I'm tired of your failed attempts to bash a great OS. One major security flaw versus the thousands that Xp has does not make win7 a horrible os
 Win7 is way better than all of microsofts os's put together
 aww timmie
 There are loads of apps that work on XP but not windows 7
 becuse most apps are designed FOR xp
 Again not seen/heard for him all weekend
 You can always have meeso tim :p
 ALL WEEK? O.O
 oops
 weekend*
 :/ I'd go to jail Andrew
 Lol if it was all week I'd have finished it xD
 yeah XD
 I was already liek WTF, but yeah, mis readed it XD
 Pie`, those applications then are old and are probably crap, if the developers of those apps can't update for vista/7 compatibilty then you need to find an alternative. 
 I've not ran into any applications that I use on a daily basiss that didn't work with vista/7
 not even a text tim?

 I suck at logos

 I just*
 I'm a better web developer I suppose
 I aint good at any :P
 Or at least I like to think I am
 www.blastingmusic.com was my most recent redesign of a site
 Mind you I had 2 hot sections above the footer but the site owner figured it be best without them, complete moron if you ask me
 one was recent/popular members the other a sort of blog feed for recent posts
 and magazine posts
 did his logo too...
 That website is awesome
 just something simple and not too cluttered for the minimal content he has on main page
 How long ddi that website take you?
 With the magazine/WP themes skinned and coded?
 hey
 Hey
 because those arnt up but i did them too...
 the WP theme version took me like 2hours to get done right after I had the initial theme coded
 The main theme took me like 6hours to design and code
 Like i said it's a pretty simple site
 link?
 magazine was a bitch because of all the featured spots, forum/blog integration he wanted involved...took me like 4-5hours to do that alone
 Mainly because SMF is lame as fook
 TSO we're talking about www.blastingmusic.com
 put the http so I can click it
 http://www.blastingmusic.com lazy ass.
 I'm on mibbit on my itouch....
 does anyone use their own rss feed agrigator page? or no...
 something like this i mean http://tonizova.com/feedsex/ that updates and what not. im thinking of adding a couple more features, packing it up and giving it away for download somewhere, don't know if people in gen would even care or be interested =\
 omfg... Mibbit sucks
 yeah you click on a link it doesnt open up a new page
 should have told you that
 but i didnt
 :D
 It opens a new page, but my itouch like clears the
 Window to save memery
 Memory
 I was wondering, who accepts the templates that are up for download on zymic?
 approves rather
 They arent accepting any anymire
 :(
 that sucks, could have been hot exposure and a crap load of backlinks at the rate they seem to be getting downloaded
 yeH
 Are we not?
 Always possible, I didn't know that though
 If there was a possibility a premium designed template would be accepted I'd make one...
 Premium is down atm
 no i mean premo theme for free download
 `ping
 `ping
 PONG
 PONG
 Oh ok
 `ping
 PONG
 `ping
 PONG
 I see
 Very slow
 brb got to go get some breakfast
 Nobody cares. :)
 Alex are there certain requirements for the themes?
  FU brandon
 :P
 ./kick Cr`eme Fuck you back :p
 eww creme
 :P
 Damn it, only if Jack left a second earlier then maybe I would have got away with the kick. Well, as long as Ed and Alex had their eyes closes ;-)
 :-P
 closed*
 No 
 Please no
 :D
 VIOLENCE!
 ^
 I could be persuaded to wander off for a while
 Alex Please Stay
 And Ed please stay
 :P
 Alex.. mind nipping to the shop for some coffee please
 IDK what movie to watch?
 ed is already gone me thinks
 Yes, seems it
 Tonfue: well, roughly equal quality in design is the only real one if Jack's still interested, I did try to ask him, but he seems to be afk
 probs found a doughnut in the kitchen or something...
 Maybe
 I love doughnuts
 Nobody cares again..
 I care
 Because we can always recode if necessary, but if you are providing code then that would have to be standards compliant, semantic markup, preferably strict valid.
 about myself
 But well, as long as the doctype isn't frameset... ;)
 Alex, you are english right/
 Cr`eme: yes, I am.
 Do yall pronounce donuts
 doughnuts?
 That's just saying it with a different spelling? O_o :p
 Yes, and that's how we spell it too.
 lol harbor = harbour
 Alex thanks, I appreciate the help, I'm pretty sure I can do something equal in quality if not a bit better & about the coded template, i'm pretty sure it'll get accepted as per what you noted above
 armor = armour
 omg
 brb going to get some more soda
 Tonfue: Show us what you can do :)
 http://www.zymic.com//free-templates/live-previews/133/index.html some example of the kind of code I consider "good enough" ;)
 The one I did :p
 is Adam afk?
 Alex easy enough :)
 Yes, I'd say so, but you may or may not be surprised by some of the stuff we get flogged at us
 Alex, which one did you make?
 The one he linked to above
 I didn't design any, I did the markup for the one I linked
 oh
 I might try and work on one
 but IDK
 It's listed as Kyle & Alex in there, because we bought it from Kyle, but the code was all tables
 Alex, can we include jquery in there?
 I don't see why not
 ok
 You can redistribute as per the MIT licensing option.
 I really need to organize my css :P
 Alex will cook up a simple design on the fly now and see if i'm on the right track.
 Why id this happnening?
 alright im back
 time to attempt to troulbe shoot ie7
 can some one tell me if this is the right snippet of code for ie only? http://i36.tinypic.com/2copjpe.jpg
 i was like 100% sure it was right but it doesnt work
 never mind i got it lol
 How do you ghost a nick in irc?

 I hate IE
 we all do
 So fucking slow
 I love chrome
 <3 Chrome
 ^
 i dont this, the images should atleast show up, regardless if they actually slide or nto
 in ie?
 ya
 its acting like those images dont exist
 not quite sure why
 me too
 gona do some extreme testing :P
 kdigennaro what is the code so that the css could be activated?
 That is placed in the head
 wat do you mean?
 o
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" type="text/css" />
 thank you
 np
 ah
 wat?
 think i found it
 seems taht overflow: hidden; is acting differently in ie
 and hidding all the images
 oh
 which kind of sucks
 i got it working now
 its crazy and not styled correctly lol
 but its functional
 kdigennaro - http://zoffix.com/new/blond_chick_with_a_nice_pussy.jpg << hawt
 lol
 lol
 rofl
 even hawter, http://zoffix.com/new/asian-girls-eating-pussy.jpg
 atleast now i no the problem
 omg 
 hey alex isnt there a code simular to the ie only style sheet, but it allows the style to be applied to everything but ie?
 because im going to need to seperate style sheets
 ah sorry to bug you i just found it
 kdigennaro - did you check out my channel yet?
 Dont
 kdigennaro do not join his channel

 meanie
 lol
 :P
 hmmmm this is driving me bonkers lol this should work but its not lol
 what is?
 I !kb him when he join #omfg
 :P
 nope, only !b
 this code should make it so that the style isnt applied to ie http://i34.tinypic.com/2j2t8w8.jpg
 I kicked after
 Cr`eme - but I left first
 but its not applying style to any browser lol
 :P w/e
 I gt get back to work
 kdigennaro - go to chat.freenode.org join #css and ask there
 thought bout it
 might in a sec
 hell might as well
 wow he doesnt under stand wat im saying :P
 :P
 Good day all
 Alex you around?
 Ignore the design (there's no design really) and let me know if the code is acceptable, if so i'll work on a hot theme based off those standards. http://www.tonizova.com/template_01/
 kdigennaro can you please give me that css code again?
 why is hter a div around a ul?
 there*
 <link rel="StyleSheet" href="css/styles.css" type="text/css" media="all"/> 
 thank you
 kdigennaro the menu div?
 tonfue why cant you just use <ul id=blah>
 ya
 you have an extra div there :P
 your indenting isnt great either
 hard to read the code
 haha, i did it pretty much on the fly, as I said, i was refering to alex pointing out it had to be stric valid
 t*
 yes
 did you check if it was valid?
 Well yes, obviously
 its possible for it to be valid, and poorley coded :P
 doesnt look like you did that bad of a job :P
 but there are somethings that could be done using less code
 id go back and clean up your code
 for 25minutes while eating sweet and sour chicken i think it's acceptable :P
 then ull be able to look better at it
 Why would I, that's not the template Im going to send in
 then whyd you code it? lol
 for practice?
 if so you might as well practice the correct way :P
 Pretty much yeah, and to see if Alex had any pointers so I'd apply them onto my template when I do it in terms of what would get it accepted and so on
 i see
 well he'll have some pointers ;)
 No shit :P
 i'll have to ask him to disregard the messyness
 fuck freenode those guys in #css are a bunch of fucking idiots
 Is someone squatting zymic's twitter account?
 this is the lamest thing ive seen
 they think im sending them viruses or some shit
 wont open my link
 what's the link for?
 if it's code just put it up on some pastebin
 no its so he can see my issue
 because he insisted that i tell him my problem rather than just asking for hte bit of code i was looking for..
 so i explained and showed him...
 bout to rage quit that chat
 i love to mess with the sql people on freenode
 they all have jumbo sized fists stuck up their asses, it's hilarious when you ask a question that's worded a little 'in general'
 there just a bunch of ass holes
 being a pain in my ass
 WOOT! pom!
 Hey

 Thanks, remind me to put it in my "I DON'T GIVE A DAMN" book.

 Cr`eme: Do you have a twitter?
 Yeah why?

 No it is ok
 I dont feel like it
 Notice I've not asked you for the url, this is how much your meaningless commentary means to me.
 w/e
 they wont open my link because they dont think i explained my problem...
 Rofl.
 Cr`eme: You obviously don't get it. You have more hate on you then I do ;-)

 :D
 and there is no cure for that
 Nope
 I cant get it
 I ate cookies
 ^
 magic cookies even
 Yeah
 w/e I just had to go to my cupboard and get some antibiotics
 you have Aids
 not swine flu
 antibiotics won't do anything
 No I went to the doctor and it came out to be negative
 :P
 that doesn't make since
 they check your blood
 sense *
 and then if it comes out negative then I wouldnt have it
 and it came out to be negative
 :p
 are you sure ?
 yup
 maybe it was a typo
 - instead of +
 Nope tested it to two times
 it was a typo for sure
 and they arent signs
 they type out negative and positive
 then I'll give it to you again
 too late
 Let me test again
 negativ
 :p
 Dolleh have you ever
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45aH27Rvj7o&feature=related
 NAMERAPE
 That was stupid..
 what's the test they do on it Cr`eme?
 It is called HIV/AIDS test nothing else
 that i know ofd
 of*
 What do they do in the test?
 draw blood samples and then test in the machine checking if HIV is in it
 ORLY
 :P
 pie, can you bitchslap creme? kthnxbai :D
 Pie` is my friends
 he aint mean
 I wouldn't go as far as to say friend, Cr`eme :P
 :P Aquaintences
 if I spelled it corectly
 wow i missed a lot :P
 a loy
 I am failing at typing today
 haha no worries
 @lex didnt come around :P
 nope
 o well ill start looking for a nice upload script that i can impliment in
 upload script for what?
 Your website?
 for that image slider
 Why would you add a upload script?
 i want to be able to upload an image have the image resized then placed in the slider
 Oh ok
 to make it easy for people to upload to it? lol
 :P
 any buddy ever use this script? http://encodable.com/filechucker/ actually looks kinda nice :D
 might make it a bit prettier
 no never did
 I use this one
 http://irc.jujuc.co.cc
 it works too
 that one i found pwns urs ;)
 :P
 Well I never found that one
 I might use it
 only thing is that it uploads right to a directory looks like
 you can chose the directory
 ya
 I made it be in the root
 Cr`eme: You're a fool right?
 ed is it dangerous to upload directly to a directory instead of going through a db or something?
 its going to be behind the admin panel for e107 so im not to worried about it for this application, but just for future information
 omg look at these robots
 ?
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2STTNYNF4lk
 they are funny
 :P
 what's being uploaded kdigennaro`bbl?
 in this case just photos
 Is there extension checking?
 I'd say it's much better to upload below web root
 do you want people to be able to downalod that picuter/
 Then serve it from th ere
 kk
 that makes sense 
 ill check it out
 im reading through this script right now
 it looks to be pretty well written, and very well commented
 kdigennaro`bbl do you want people to view it or download it?
 view it
 Well that uloader only lets them download
 yeah theres extension checking ed
 creme thats easy to change ;)
 ok
 :P
 heres the extension check block http://i36.tinypic.com/jskpxj.jpg
 If you can work it in below web root and have a script serve it, it's better if not and it's for admin only, you should be okay... where's the function that does the check?
 um gotta find it lol
 one sec
 found just gotta find specific code block
 here it is http://pastesite.com/8888
 It's Bread muppet
 sorry
 lol
 You're such an arse.
 impersonating a zymic mod :P pretty sure thats a fellony :P
 or is it a felony?
 no my nick was beard
 lol
 Should of let him change his nick back
 * kdigennaro`bbl senses someone getting kicked :D
 im phycic lol
 I cant ghost for some reason
 nah... im bad with graphics... just so long as it looks ok with the current website... im not bothered
 i cant tell if i like this font for this page or not :P
 lol alrighty
 What is the link ?
 http://i34.tinypic.com/11c8n6e.jpg
 No I dont like the font
 that bold font mihgt be better
 ya i dont think i do either :P
 i mean i like it
 but not for this lol
 It coule
 yea i was jus gonna suggest goin bold lol
 all the other font types are a bit fatty type...that one is too skinny to fit it lol
 well i figured it was already bold so itd try to opposite :P
 kdigennaro for the Lorum Ipsum Logo should I use the initials only
 Li
 wat u mean?
 I making a template logo
 should I put Lorum Ipsum 
 or Li
 For the logo
 up to u
 jaxm trying to recreate the gradient ther
 alrighty
 Ok
 im afraid this isnt going to line up
 :/
 alright here u go
 http://i34.tinypic.com/2hzim2o.jpg
 as good as i can do for now
 gotta eat dinner :d
 if your still around after i can make the gradient look better, and might be able to find a nicer font
 alright cool
 well there is a bit of black on the outside there :S
 o oops

 Hey Frank
 Hi
 Does anyone know the css code to make a .png file transparent?
 hey
 Hey Perry 
 Hey Perry
 Hell all
 Hell :P
 it sure is hell todaqy yeah\
 typing fail^
 creme
 theres no code.. lol
 png's are transparent
 Oh 
 :P
 :P
 :P I herd of it the other day
 or somewhere
 :P
 would you like me to make up some code to make u feel better? :P
 lol
 there might be a crack or something to make them transparent in ie 6 and earlier
 lol
 brandon you got that special css code to make png's transparent? :D
 hey kdigennaro, feel up for another banner being made? :P
 haha sure
 sweet
 same type of thing... gradient may need to be changed
 kk
 well actually
 did they supply the psd with the template?
 well this isn't part of the template
 [00:34:45] <+kdigennaro> brandon you got that special css code to make png's transparent? :D
 isn't it just; background: transparent; ?
 I think
 lol
 :d
 :P
 was makeing fun of creme
 instead of just being some text with a link... would prefer it to be in a jpeg
 <Iqbal> Does anyone know the css code to make a .png file transparent?
 lol
 text would be "View our current playlist and request a song here!"
 the Tune In "button" that came with the site is a reddish...so maybe keep it that type of profile?
 link?
 maybe 3 - 3.5 inches wide and 3/4 of inch tall...
 and i refuse to use jpeg :P
 http://jaxmthemirc.uuuq.com/radio/index.html
 thats all i have lol
 ill make it a png ;)
 cool
 were is this going?
 well its going on a new page i have not uploaded yet... still working on it
 so iono wat im making lol
 layout is still the same though
 so ya see where it says Welcome to our radio station?
 It would be going underneath in that section
 ya
 kk
 cant u just do that in html?
 theres no reason to mkae that an image
 erm sure?
 lol idk
 sec i will show
 alrighty
 i was thinking if maybe ya just took the current Tune In image and just resized it with that text overlaying it...
 do you no nay html?
 any*
 i know some but im learning this all from scratch as im building this
 because if you open the index.html file
 http://i36.tinypic.com/15foqqb.jpg
 ull see a line that looks exactly like that first line
 then i just added the second line in there
 hmm
 now if you want the text to be a different size tahn the welcome... text then ull need to edit the css a little
 yea suppose i could do that
 but its very simple
 yea that looks fine =]
 also question for ya...
 how could i make a link open in a new tab... not as a popup, but to keep it from navigating from that screen?
 like i have <a href="contactus.htm" title="">contact us</a> for a link
 um
 i think its this
 <a href="http://www.quackit.com/html/html_help.cfm" target="_blank">HTML Help</a> 
 had to get a quick refresher ;) havent done that in html lol
 lol
 that opens the link in a new window
 hmm
 is that wat u mean?
 so yours would look like this... sec
 <a href="contactus.htm" target="contactus.htm" title="">contact us</a>
 ?
 what is that title="" thing anyway?
 <a href="contactus.htm" target="_blank">contact us</a>
 you dont need that
 oh ok
 but if its there...it doesnt do anything right?
 the way u have it it doesnt do anything
 not even sure if its a valid tag, ive never used it
 ok cool, ill leave it in my current ones then heh
 CONTACTUS!
 lol
 that sounds funny if you make it one word
 lol yea
 wait a sec
 for the target="" part
 do i use _blank or the file name?
 im geussing blank...
 _blank, that'll open a new window or tab
 gotcha
 please don't drop me
 _blank
 sorry was doing somthing for creme lol
 butter?
 Lol I am creme again
 :P
 lol
 :P
 if you get the actual file from perry i can do this better creme ;)
 but its not that hard
 almost done
 OK
 :P
 Do what, kdigenarro?
 Nothing I asked him if he could edit the logo
 Because my Adobe Skills SUCK
 :)
 he just gave me the png though :P
 did u use ai for that perry?
 no photoshop
 kk
 could tell for sure
 coudlnt*
 this is pretty close http://i37.tinypic.com/1zg6qm1.jpg
 lol nice one
 Really close
 could get closer but tbh dont feel like it LO
 are you making it transparent?
 because i could have done it in 3 seconds lol
 he asked me to re make it with different letters lol
 i told him he should just ask u for the file :P
 but easy enough to redo
 haha ooh

 thats the box?
 box and text
 the actual box is three layers
 one for the top gradient
 what is shape 4
 one for bottom, and one for glow
 o its the bottom of the text

 hmm
 can ya get that one changed into a green?
 i can try

 and maybe with that little bulb thingy, one could be dimmed down...to kinda represent it being offline or online
 dark or light green?
 erm... like dark?
 or light? :S
 wichever you think is better lol
 heres green http://i34.tinypic.com/8yrxhc.jpg
 ah yea thats perfect =]

 What is the css code for adding a logo?
 nice perry

 k hold
 awesome thanks again =]
 creme trick question
 a logo or an image?
 :P 
 :D
 Logo
 np jaxm
 Jack u actually here?
 now i just gotta figure out how to incorporate the script in there :/
 trying to find some one with great html/css knowledge to answer a question for me :D
 uh....
 That would be you
 :P
 not really lol
 kdigennaro is the person to talk to. :P
 im not bad
 Do you know the css code for adding a image?
 but im nothing compare to @lex j@ck or @ndrew and bre@d
 depends how you want to add it creme
 you could use several ways
 Well I want it one the top
 On the left
 :P
 Is that helpful?
 you could either add it in the actual css using a background: url("....);
 CSS 
 you could use that with a div or a h tag
 if its a logo id use an h tag with alt text
 or you could use an img src tag
 http://www.alexperry.net/ai_logo.png
 you like creme?
 Nicer
 :P
 I would use a CSS
 could you help me
 What?
 i used this
 .header {
 	background: url(images/logo.png) no-repeat;
 and..
 but then it didnt work in the DIV
 you need to add a width and height
 oh
 :?
 set the width and height to the dimensions of the logo
 hes right
 What is the dimension kdigennaro?
 and its good to have url("images/logo.png")
 just hover over it creme
 it will tell u
 ok
 without a width and height, the background will only show with text in the div
 ^
 I am using xampp to edit it
 :P
 good idea
 the dimesion is
 194 x 205
 what would the css code be?
 so width: 194px;
 height: 205px;
 yes
 lets see if it works
 it will
 do you want to see the code I used?
 pastebin.com
 Andrew :o
 andrew :D
 lol
 Andrew!
 Hey ed
 Hi Andrew
 Hi andrew
 Andrew you are back
 :P
 Cr`eme, stfu
 Quiet Perry, Andrew time ;-)
 lol
 :X
 fine asshole
 Only joking, hey Perry :-p
 :P
 :p
 I feel like shit 
 Why Andrew?
 but thought i'd let everyone know i'm alive
 Swine flu
 ?
 ^
 Ed I really have to wonder
 I has symptoms
 andrew wat happened to u?
 Guys the CSS didnt work
 you sleep with that nasty chick at work?
 It's no huge worry
 :(
 creme thats cus u did it wrong lol
 :P
 Most people can fight it off as a normal flu bug
 Swine flu is no more danger to people than seasonal flu
 It's just scale which is different
 ^
 Alex: seasonal flu doesnt kills o many people
 More people have died from standard flu than swine flu
 alex you're acutally here :D
 nro does it spread this fast :P
 swine flu didn't acctually come from pigs
 Pie`: seasonal flu has an almost identical death rate
 cough, runny nose or stuffy nose,body aches, headache, chills, fatigue or tiredness
 I have all those
 :P
 And the spreading is... exactly why the scale is different?
 sounds like aids tbh andrew
 I don't have sore throat, or diarrhea or vomiting
 so that's nice
 lol
 kdigennaro this is the cod
 http://pastesite.com/8890
 that doesnt look like cod to me... looks like code..
 :P
 Code
 Hope you get to feeling better Andrew
 http://www.komar.org/faq/seward-fishing/alaska-ling-cod/ling-cod-1.jpg this is cod
 :D
 :P
 ty frankie poo
 has anyone ever been as far as decided to use even go want to do look more like?
 thanks andrew :D thats better :D
 ^
 creme
 http://pastesite.com/8891
 I'm going to have nightmares now Andrew :-p
 Why ed?
 prob wont fix ur prob so paste the html
 :P
 ok
 Pie`: perhaps try those words in a different order?
 Maybe just start over :p
 kdigennaro this is the html
 http://pastesite.com/8892
 Cr`eme, thats why
 instead of .header
 use #header
 oh ok
 :p
 in your css
 thought that was the reason
 Andrew thank you
 hey andrew
 id= # class=.
 id looking for a bit of code to help creme out
 <Iqbal> Does anyone know the css code to make a .png file transparent?
 The fish Andrew 
 do you know that code ^?
 :P
 Um, save the PNG file with transparency?
 yes, make it transparent in photoshop
 lol
 Andrew: that doesn't work for Ie
 that was a legit question earlier :D lol
 in IE it takes the background colour an manipulates it
 it does with some javascript hacks
 ;)
 or doesn something to it
 alex did you get my memo earlier?
 IE can handle transparency in PNGs, it doesn't handle alpha.
 If you save it with 8-bit transparency it works back to IE6
 I will work on it tommorow
 I dont feel like it now
 But you can go up to IE7 now
 :P
 ah i actually didnt know that alex
 So you can go up to 24-bit transparency
 :D
 bye bye
 cya creme
 kdigennaro: I'll get back to that some time later.
 I won't be around for long
 kk
 is it that involved?
 I dunno
 I haven't looked
 kk :D
 man this image slider is kicking my butt today :P lol

 Hey Frank
 Hi

 http://paste.jujuc.co.cc/demo?
 Who is using chrome here?
 lmao!!
 creme got booted for spamming me :P
 :P
 nn zymic
 forgot I had irc open
 omg i'ts only 10:15 and I feel like I could pass out
 is that good or bad
 i dunno, I feel like this because I have swine flu
 lol
 cool, you'll be on the news when you die
 look for me "Andrew Baker of Fort Myers, Florida dies of swine flu"
 watch, nobody will write about it
 heh, weren't you saying that it was very unlikely for you to get the swine flue ? :D
 I'm trying to decide if I just go lay down now, or try to make it to midnight to take more medicine
 Hey
 yo perry
 Hey dronix
 To be honest I doubt I have swine flu, just because I had something simliar about 6 months ago. It was just a fever and a bad cough with a mildly runny nose.
 I probably don't eat enough vitamins or something
 brb
 I had runny nose abou a week ago, it sucked, didn't have fever though
 I leave for florida tomorrow morning :(
 hmm, what for?
 I don't know if I really have a fever, I don't have a thermometer, but I feel warm
 but I'm freezing at the same time
 it sucks
 and I'm sore all over
 Perry what part of florida?
 West Palm Beach
 oh nice
 lucky
 I'm on the other coast, fort myers
 I'm like directly west of where you'll be
 Well im going there for rehab.
 http://www.anewdayrehab.com
 Oh well that stinks
 How old are you?
 rehab? you crazy or something?
 drug and alcohol it says

 yes
 hmm
 august is almost over, now is when the hurricane season starts to pick kup
 August isn't here yet dronix
 ;)
 you'll end up more depressed by the time you leave florida lol
 heh I mean july is almost over
 :P
 And we're only a few days over half
 almost over :P
 hurricane charley happened on my birthday, august 13th
 it was a friday the 13th too
 nice
 im scared of hurricanes :S
 Hurricanes aren't normally bad
 and im going down there in hurricane season?!
 bull.shit.
 do you not see new orleans/
 Not for florida, there have only been about 2 really devastating ones for florida, and new orleans was a bit of a freak accident, and there are conspiracy theories that they blew up the levee there
 2 in the past 20 years that I know of
 charley and andrew lol
 andrew messed up miami in the early 90's
 heh, next one is dronix
 hah
 I wonder if we'll have a bad one next year, because august 13th 2010 is another friday the 13th
 Perry, it would be hilarious if they named a hurricane after you while you're there and it becomes cat 3 or more
 no it wouldnt.
 They start at A every year, right?
 how long will you be staying in florida?
 Perry they have one name per alphabet letter per year
 1-3 months

 Claudette,

 Alex is it possible to have an ID/class which does not inherit ANY styles?
 I don't know of anything which lets you do that
 http://www.webmasterworld.com/css/3432290.htm
 Hello :) I have another question ...
 Hello Nizzle 
 Is it hosting related?
 Hi Ed, no
 Ohh Hey Nizzle, it's Bread.
 Bread hi@
 hi!
 I wondered where you were earlier
 Hey. How's are things in Africa?
 Cold, can you believe it
 Yeah, switched to my real name for a bit.
 That is hard to believe.
 Is cold to you, what, 30c? ;-)
 Lol more like 10!
 Heh, rare that we can say we're warmer than Africa (or well part of it :-p)
 Anyway. I guess you are just the person to talk to then... remember when I first came here I was trying to get my includes to work? I changed all the pages to .php and that sorted it out fine. Well on my current site I went through changing everything and now realised by changing it all my old pages have the good rankings... 
 Basically, how do I get my .html files to read my includes... 
 lol XD
 Ahah, some .htaccess magic.
 Nizzle: Try adding "AddType application/x-httpd/php .html" to a .htaccess file
 or are they all .php files now, can rewrite it so .html goes to the .php counterpart
 Something like (i'll pastesite)
 They are all .php but I want to change them back but then they aren't reading the includes
 I renamed them all last time didn't I?
 Yes
 Sorry my Filezilla doesnt want to launch
 Ok let me just check
 Should I change everything back to .html
 Nizzle: Add this to a .htaccess http://pastesite.com/8910
 Just tested it, seems to work without an issue.
 http://bread.vndv.com/nizzle.html
 Eugh stupid FileZilla. It wont launch. I better reboot.
 Sorry about that Bread :(
 I swear I am going to break my computer one of these days
 Anyway, I located my htaccess file. I just want to check, the code I am going to put in, it isnt masking is it?
 Well masking, but on a server level, so anything outside of it won't know it's happening.
 You send the request for foo.html, server says, okay, send back foo.php, but the url remains as 'foo.html' do you have any other .html files?
 The whole website is html
 If you have a file called foo.html and a file called foo.php, the foo.php will take precedence 
 Also if you go to blahblah.html and blahblah.php doesn't exist, you get a 404
 I can make it so it only rewrites if the file doesn't exist (a .html one)
 I dont understand though... I just want to read includes in .html files
 http://pastesite.com/8911
 Probably better
 Without losing my ranking from Google
 Yep, this will do that.
 Well, no, this is a solution for that
 Your addtype was what he's describing, but isn't really the best way of solving it.
 Ok... is there an easier way?
 Shoudl I contact my adminstrator person
 Ed's solution is ideal, but it should really be noted that it's not exactly what you're describing
 Because it is server-level masking.
 So Google wont like it?
 Google won't know you're doing it
 But it has implications on how /you/ name your pages.
 :S
 Look, what Ed is describing will do this:
 If there is a .html file, it uses that, no PHP parsing
 If there is no .html file but there is a .php with the same name/location, then it serves the .php file as .html
 But it does parse the PHP
 So, if you want to parse PHP, you make foo.php, and reference it as foo.html
 If you don't want to parse PHP you just make foobar.html
 Aah ok
 My brain hurts
 Thanks again for your help guys :)
 Id probably die a slow death without you all

 Yes rebel ty
 The drive to Frisco was still 2 hours
 TheOracle: pm me your email and I'll email it to you when I can
 however, the planeride home was actually _4 hours_!
 k rebel
 you should have gave me that planeride D:
 4 hours is nothing
 anyway while on the plane (no wifi) I made a masthead for a potential new design for my site
 gonna upload it in a bit

 Hmm my textbox bg is not howing
 *showing
 Maybe that site 
 Anyone on Linux?
 Nope I took it off :P
 How does this look? http://sroracle.uni.cc/workingdraft/
 Thats what I did on the plane
 Jack - which website do you have?
 http://zymic.com/~w2hidem/index.php?q=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mYWNlYm9vay5jb20%3D&hl=0
 Was testing my new proxy header design and ad
 Jack,  you made HideMyArse?
 ass
 no, he did
 Do you like my new header people?
 Yes
 Flash ad not too annoying/
 ?
 nope
 looks nice to me
 no Jack, looks nice
 Old one http://zymic.com/~w4hidem/index.php?q=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5mYWNlYm9vay5jb20%3D&hl=0
 facebook colours so it looks better on that page (colour wise)
 yea new one is lots better
 who made it Jack ?
 bannaz.com
 I expected something better though
 Jack, the new one is better
 if you told me I could have done it for you
 :P
 Forgot you did Flash
 I do need a flash guy though for a new project
 just ask if you need anything
 rebel, you know flash? I suck at flash
 :P
 I need a video perspective'ized
 If that makes sense ;)
 not for me
 sec
 k
 http://i27.tinypic.com/2dt9950.jpg
 So video plays at this perspective
 Oh
 Seems hard to do
 I see.... But unfortunately I cant help czu Isuck at flash
 no not in flash
 In what then?
 mmmm no wait
 it can be hard
 Some video edit software then import into flash?
 wait I want to make sure I get you right
 you mean you want the animation to be in that black bit only
 and to be tilted that way
 Yes
 I think that is possible
 a video from .avi/.mpg
 I guess flash CS4 can do it
 wmv
 it has 3d engine 
 so I can make the animation and z-rotate it
 I'm not sure if it can do it though
 when do you want it Jack? I'm kind of busy till wednesday I guess
 Oh not important for now, prob 2 weeks time
 Dolleh how does this look so far?
 http://sroracle.uni.cc/workingdraft

 Ubuntu on Windows
 How does this look? I've been working on it :D
 http://sroracle.uni.cc/workingdraft
 Do you do that?
 No, I have ubuntu installed on a seperate hard drive
 well, kubuntu
 But you can use Wubi
 ^
 http://wubi-installer.org/
 I use it for Kubuntu
 Ok
 or there was this other ubuntu thing that ran as if it were a virtual machine
 it popped open the gnome task bar on your desktop, and showed all the open ubuntu programs in your windows task bar
 it was pretty nifty
 Andrew?
 TheOracle?
 Take a look? :D
 http://sroracle.uni.cc/workingdraft
 it horizontally scrolls for me TheOracle 
 Yea :/
 I dunno why
 But does it look nice?
 It's okay, I really liked the theme you had before
 ?
 TheOracle: all that time just doing Item #2 ?
 Nah
 I was away talking
 Item #2 didn't take long
 anyway, I think that'll be it for the masthead, going to start on the body (post and sidebar etc)
 in js what does the error "unterminated string literal" mean ?
 nvm
 it appears you cant have returns in js 
 in a string in js *
 woot it works
 ^_^
 Brandon: can you un-suspend my account please? :d

 Example post up woo
 http://sroracle.uni.cc/workingdraft
 bbl lunch
 is tehre a way to combine 2 images in a PHP script
 so if you wanted to create 1 image form a background and a render
 how would you paste the render onto the background with php
 DIE D<
 i'm going back to mibbit D<
 I jsut made a function in php for checking if a number is odd or not
 originally it was 7 lines long
 or there abouts
 i turned it down to 1 :D
 and not by cutting out new lines
 Pie`: pastesite ?
 moose ?
 yes rebel?
 what does moose mean ?
 depends how you look at it XD
 but its one of my many nicknames :P
 no really Dolleh, what does it mean?
 rebel: return (is_int($num)) ? ($num%2==0) ? 0 : 1 : 0;
 moose is an animal
 ^
 its an animal and it means "ugly girl" in slang
 thas all I know off
 stfu you moose
 :P
 Pie`: double ternary form?  Nasty.
 Why not make that one boolean expression
 Because you would need to check if its an int first? D:
 return (is_int($num) && ($num%2==1));
 Is equivalent
 btw Alex what happened with the question I gave you ?
 maths question
 The one you said you'd already done?
 yeah
 I didn't think you wanted any input on that
 it was a nice question I liked to share it with you
 Heh, can't say I do calculus for fun much, I was happy to take your word for it :p
 it's basically about if A + b = 1 , then how to prove that A * B <= 1/2
 haha
 Pie`: yep, I checked it, that's exactly the expression for "is this odd"
 I spent about 2 hours trying to prove it and I couldn't then my friend's brother who is a math genius proved it in 5 mins 
 I was like :O
 Alex: Mine works just as good, and looks cooler :D
 does anyone have a good dictionary file ?
 Dictionary file?
 yeah
 a big text file with lots of words in it
 word uses then, open office
 anyhting with a spell checker
 uses a dictionary file
 Use theirs?
 How? ^^ I don't know where they are
 Where's sBot... I'd use his google otherwise...

 So if I run

 Temp?
 or a tmp generated folder in the cmd ftp directory that handles this particular session
 folder usaully will have a wild name of alphanumeric characters randomly
 Yes
 I tried searching but nothing

 in most programs without knowing any programming languages
 I have heard of that
 it's a nice program to look at everything in a program and do my thing
 I might check it out
 Still around?
 I had to hack x-tree to accept 16/32 bit words
 I see
 I don't really want to get into modding shit at this hour
 I just need to check a couple of things
 use a program on itself that was fun
 Well everyone

 Any americans here?
 anybody here
 yo
 nobody in host room
 i wanna ask about my site
 any admin or Mod here?
 i'm an american Jack
 no admin here
 they might be a little busy at the moment, hang tough vnnonline_org
 hi there, how is everybody
 good, and you
 i need help from any admin or mod!
 I have a particular issue: when I try to connect via FTP, after the password is sent the connection halts
 and then timeout
 does anyone experienced this?
 check your port setting?
 i'm not admin or moderator, the Zymic Team appears to busy at the moment
 let me chk my filezilla
 yap I am usign filezilla :)
 and the port is 21, passive mode
 its just... after the password is sent
 my filezilla connects right up to my uuuq site
 no error message, no nothing, just timeout
 firewall?
 ok, thanks for your help BlackTie 
 JaXm: if the user command is accepted
 and I did sucessfuly logged in in other ftp accounts
 but its a good tip
 I always forget about the windowZ fw
 :)
 =]
 well I really appreciate your help, but don't worry...
 I will try with another ftp client
 was it an ECCONNECT error
 how can contact Admin soon? anybody know how?
 nop, it just timeout after the password is sent
 and then while trying to connect again it will give me an error message like 2 connections from the same ip address
 ohhhh
 someone had this problem last night
 something like go to your settings.. and where it says Maximum Connections, set it to 1
 hum, already did that :)
 hey don't worry
 thanks and have a very nice day!
 beyond me, I know they are pretty good about attendance here and in the Hosting chat, I would hang tough for a while if you have the time
 how can contact Admin soon? anybody know how?
 There has to be something up, otherwise they would be here
 if it is really pressing go to the Hosting Chat room and wait there, I'm positive (saving they all died) they will be there, have you check the news an information thread in the forum for what might be up if anything
 I wonder what Jack was looking for an american for?
 hi all how are things?
 could you please be kind enough to help me unsubscribe from the forum?
 hello, I'm fine, you'll have to wait for one of the Zymic Team, they appear to be busy at the moment
 how are you doing
 thanks
 feeling nice like sugar and spice
 I just want to unsubscribe and / or delete the forum account
 the help and h2 are not helping at all :)
 I don't think that'll be a problem, but you will have to chat with one of the Zymic Team
 sure, thanks :)
 the delete function is a nonusable by members only staff I believe
 keeps mistakes from happening
 so where are you from, I'm in Wisconsin USA
 ok
 new york
 upstate, manhatten? I'm in Madison
 hi huhyo
 upstate
 Lisbon, Portugal
 they must really be busy
 why are you not a channel operator?
 where are admins?
 no, I am not affiliated with the Zymic Team
 They appear to be busy at the moment
 http://imageshare.uuuq.com/ can everyone  log into that with nasty messages  im trying to report this phishing page some prick sent my friend but the admins are all in hiding
 otherwise someone would be monitoring this and the other Hosting Chat
 ahh no worries they got my message and deleted it
 Thanks Jack
 BlackTie: but you should
 you could help lots of us :)
 but I can not out of respect for you primarily, and equally for Zymic
 thats no out of respect...
 au contraire
 its an appreciation for your dedication and politeness regarding the "us"
 I'd hate myself if I was to send you in the wrong direction not knowing the workings of Zymic, but I appreciate the kind words
 I'm very young here at Zymic and I'm really not network inclined
 I see
 I'll go as far as being a receptionist when they are busy
 what do you do for a living?
 hihi free receptionist :D
 I'm educated in Electronics Engineering and Drafting (CADD)

 Hello
 Bread your on
 Am I?
 ZARDOZ here, things are backing up out here
 Oh hey. How's the site going?
 good, I've got the small nuances out and figured the multiplicity thing out
 got it on the puter here not at the site yet though
 argh...
 filing for unemployment is a pain
 Something must be up no one has been here for a while and people have come and gone
 I kinda, with JaXm, filled in the best we could
 ftp errors and the like
 Breads gone to now, there must be a One-Eyed Purple People Eater loose at Zymic
 lol
 Don't go to the UK people are just vanishing
 :P
 heh
 well i can start claiming unemployment next wed :/
 ah your back, Bread
 rent is due next thursday
 and get extended benefits
 Bread is it bad
 im gonna go lay down for a bit more
 and leave here alone
 me alone*
 lol im sorry
 back in an hour or two
 ok, hopefully I'll be in bed by then
 depends on how soon
 good music though
 well
 Dolleh isn't even here
 Ed: are you there? :)
 Yep
 how are you doing?
 how can I unsubscribe from the forum?
 Not too thanks. Unsubscribe?
 Keep getting emails when someone posts in a thread?
 no, I mean
 remove my forum account
 delete it from the syste
 m
 Strange request, I can do it, but I don't know if you can actually reinstate it at a later date. Why may I ask?
 sure
 I experienced some problems in using my account
 and I no longer need it
 What's the user?
 lusitanv
 You joined today foforurumm, what if you have any further issues?
 don't worry, thanks for the question
 I alread removed my web hosting account
 You've been deleted from the forum
 thank you very much Ed
 well see you soon and good luck
 I wound up exercising the sami web from earlier last night after aligning the code to see what was the gist and in exercising I replaced files to see if I had it right and they worked, I figure I'll look deeper at it to understand the multiple call from one link
 and in doing so Ed I learned a little more about the css structure
 Quite fun dissecting code isn't it.
 yeah, It's kinda scary looking at codifications and understanding whats going on (that alignment trick really opens the door wide
 makes my a little more dangerous
 my= me
 I got the hots to learn as much as I can now, it's like a continual hungred feeling - I just hope I'm not like the Romans and eat until I puke to go eat more never being satisfied
 :P
 I can see the beauty of coding without the repressions of institutional learning setting your mindset as to how convention would create
 I'd like to get a site up that gives the feeling of the 3-D up and down staircases
 the illusion one
 Finally...
 whew
 seems my wifi sotware can't cope with psk2
 Hey Rob.
 Heh BlackTie wouldn't that mean it goes no where? If we're referring to the Escher drawing
 New Sticker

 OKay... Wrong paste
 not really evrything would be right side up where you are at but everthing thing else would be topsy-turvy until you entered another landing, then where you were would be different
 yeah like that
 has anyone ever done a markov chain thing for php ?
 after all Ed my last name is DrEscher
 Bread?
 Can you try to log into  my server?

 I clicked ok like 20 times
 it's changed its local ip, causing all the sbot problems
 Robert: it keeps popping up 'domain:' for me
 Yep, same here

 Ever seen this before?
 Very odd, is it definitely you IP address?
 I'm just checking
 butie isbusycrashing my computer

 strange, not something I've seen before
 what's the interactive keyboard log in thing?
 holy fuck

 BlackTie: That's where the partyvan comes in
 where you get it from, i gotta see this

 i'm one lucky bastard with my colleague's :D
 ?
 Y, there is something wrong there, compression in compression and it comes out just fine, I think I'd be running a very extensive hueristic anti-viral across it if I even bothered to download it, if it looks to good to be true ...
 keep me posted on your venture Pie, that would be nice
 BlackTie: I already have it, its a laod of text files lol
 hey all
 hey TheOracle
 hi TO, so Pie is it all just a listing of words or is there any meaniful communication beside just a listing
 BlackTie: Do I know you?
 BlackTie: They're usually used for brute force
 crackers, yes TO -ZARDOZ
 ah
 why are you BlackTie now?
 BlackTie: Yes

 Lost a lifelong girl friend this morning to a heart attack so for a week I'll mourn

 Anyone know what 'Value Error : color attempt to find a semi-colon before the property name. add it' means for the w3c css validator?
 I don't have a clue.
 To, why would I know? i? dolleh!
 Have you got link to it on actual page, TheOracle ??
 Yea Dave
 Link me..
 http://tinyurl.com/nfsjzz
 I have that error twice
 I need help to.
 WAIT YOUR TURN >:O
 I need to know how to make certain areas in the backround using CSS.
 mom has to fuck off, for real D:
 O_O
 oh
 I get it I think :P
 forgot some semicolons, rofl
 xD
 Now I need help.
 yeh.. just pastesited it to see :p
 why ftp work so poor
 Easy to fix
 yea
 Or I could see if that other tutorial will help me.
 reval'd, its fixed now :D
 :(
 Skippy|MT link?
 Link to what?
 to your site/page you're having css problems with
 Oh.
 I'm not really having problems
 I just need to learn how to make certain parts clickable.
 Oh, and I also need to know how to make it so that can scroll down.
 http://skippy.66ghz.com/
 I was thinking of using Cr`eme's webhost thing, but then I found out that I could use htaccess in Zymic as well, and I also found out that zymic has more bandwith and storage allowed.
 overflow:scroll iirc
 under body {} in your css
 Okay...
 And now to make stuff clickable.
 Skippy|MT I think it'll be better if you start by using a free template
 But I want to take the extra mile to use self-made templates.
 There's numerous problems from the beginning :/
 I want something that says, "I made this by myself, for myself."
 I don't want people to see me as "Look, I found this template off of the web and I'm going to use it for my site!"
 Ed/Adam/Alex can someone please try to log into my server?
 It appears to be up here
 The reason there's so many problems is because it's under construction.
 but I can't check ssh
 Why not?..
 Because my screen is attached to it
 in a different room

 Jack you owned lfff?
 I certainly hope not.
 did you try to ask PayPal who transferred the money?
 oic
 well
 I think I'm done; just need to convert it to a wordpress theme

 Jack - cool "wanted" post :P you designed?
 Lol, nice Jack ;)
 Jack: Can you not talk to Godaddy about it?
 No
 You have to file a court ruling with ICANN
 Costs thousands of dollars
 The name is worth $200-500 ..
 Thats sad.
 Jack - what was on lllf.com?
 Yes you should contact ICANN.
 Nothing was on it

 Dave, making a point.
 What dolleh?
 I still need a bit of help.
 I can't scroll down on my website.
 Link again
 http://skippy.66ghz.com/
 I managed to make certain areas clickable
 use overflow:scroll
 Oh.
 OMG, my dog is being very crazy
 Skippy|MT the overflow bit isn't inside body { }
 Oh, it's supposed to be in body.
 and take out "iirc" :p
 xD
 Now it doesen't work at all.
 you're missing a ; now
 after background-image:url('websitetemplate.png')
 Needs a semicolon
 Yeah.
 I added it, and now I see scrollbars.
 I just can't scroll down.
 heh
 Because there is no content
 There is in the picture...
 Okay.
 The page ends where the picture ends
 background picture is not content
 I'll just make a bunch of <p> tags at the side.
 Put a load of <br> in
 Skippy|MT: why not try using a free template and use that as a guide?
 just so you can see what we mean
 good bye.
 Okay.
 http://www.zymic.com/free-templates/134/live-preview/
 If I upload a .zip file, will I be able to extract it using the web-based file manager?
 no sidesphere
 :(
 because the FTP problems are taking so long to fix and I want to get my site up
 you need to unzip the contents of the file in your computer first
 dronix: my site has some rather complex hierarchy, and I don't want to upload files one by one. I ended up getting some errors last time :P
 you'll just have to wait
 ok
 are there any alternatives?
 unplug for a day or two
 Okay, now I can scroll down as far as I want.
 Thanks!

 great to hear :)
 Easier to do now
 Integrating it is easy
 Well, this is my first time integrating a theme into wordpress
 so/so
 apparently WP 2.8.2 is out too
 yes, security patch
 Yes, very important security patch
 Some plugins caused it
 TheOracle: It's all simple. Just like HTML/CSS
 Yesh I know
 I got the sidebar done
 Anything global (header/footer) goes in header.php and footer.php
 Yea, and it's all downhill from there. ;)
 has anyone else here seen the new HP film ?
 Yes
 did anyone else think it was shit? 
 Dumbledore reminds me of Ed
 not yet, i? getting the DVD in 2 weeks D:
 No one else is allowed to teleport in the grounds but Dumbledore is.
 yes, saw it two days ago, bootleg
 I saw it :O
 i thought it was shit tbh
 yesterday actually
 I thought it was too much talking. Not enough boobs/bush action
 Personally it was fine, just like the book in the sense that not much happened
 I saw the new HP one aswell
 there wasnt enough fighitng etc.
 Yeh
 thats how it was in the book really
 the fighting starts in the next two movies
 if you read the book you'll understand why there wasn't that much action
 exactly
 indeed
 I don't read much :P
 takes too long
 I skim
 the plot line for that book was just for Harry to figure out why Voldemort wouldn't die
 Yeah I got that much from the film
 that was it really
 I read b5 in one day, took me about 16hrs to read
 I love books :D but the HP books got boring
 was it 5 or 6?
 they didn't show Dumbledore's funeral
 can't remember now
 6 dronix
 6
 ah 6
 haven't read 7 yet
 7 is going to be two movies
 7 was good
 better than 6 imo
 lol Bran couldn't take it anymore :P
 too much books for him
 haven't read a book in ages, might pick up another goerge orwell book soon though
 ORWELL FTW

 wow my mum is a fool
 she is paying £21/m for demon broadband

 "its the cheapest unlimited broadband package in our area"

 about a minute it took em to find a better
 one
 £17.50/m  24mbit uncapped
 -_- I need help with FTP.
 what kind?
 I need to modify one little tiny piece of code
 so the second tab takes the user to another link rather than rickm.co.cc.
 I'm on my sixth attempt
 That one failed.
 Sorry i have no idea what you're talking about right now
 come again?
 -_-
 Try logging on to FTP.
 I was barely able to connect
 and I'm trying to modify the index.
 However, when I try to download it so I can edit it
 it fails.
 index of your blog or your site?
 Yes.
 My site.
 http://rickm.co.cc
 Right then why download it? don't you have it on your HDD already? edit that then upload it
 It should rewrite the current index file
 That will fail.
 What FTP are you using?
 Moz or CofC?
 FileZilla.
 Ah
 Ok i have an idea
 You got IE?
 Do you have IE?
 Yes.
 I also have Firefox
 which is better than IE.
 if so then try this, type ftp://username:password@rickm.co.cc in your url bar in IE
 it should give you ftp access, just drag and drop the file onto your desktop, edit and drag and drop it back into the directory you got it from. root i presume. Should work.
 The connection to the server was reset while the page was loading.
 Then your host is messing up, try to login through your hostings cpanel to edit it or something to that effect
 Too many connections [2] from this IP
 I'm stil trying ftp://username:password@rickm.co.cc
 Login Authentication Failed
 Wait
 I know why
 hi is zymic is down?
 No.
 Apparently, only the FTP server is failing.
 I'm probably going to take 30 minutes'
 on a edit that'd take 1-2 minuted.
 minutes*
 cuz i cant access to my site
 Try it again.

 although its only for accounts that you know the username + pass
 http://lab.lostpixel.net/classes/twitter/
 how can i get a domin with out zymic or vdnv
 Buy one.
 or use http://co.cc
 how much
 co.cc is free
 Yeah.
 there 167 bnp mebmers in my country
 netfirms.com and godaddy are both pretty cheap
 county *
 But, it's free, but you have to choose a name that you can get for 0 dollars.
 namecheap.com is too iirc
 >5$ for a .com at netfirms
 Namecheap is $9.69/yr IIRC
 But you do get more functionality from it than most
 I had fun trying to get a co.cc domain name for free.
 I came out with rickm.co.cc for one year.
 In any case, one domain is a trivial sum of money for a year
 thing is am hosting a private server
 i used to ucoz
 Brb.

 I like using opacity for the rollover effects, such as lightening text or image clarity, but IE hasnt cought up yet
 damn M$
 isn't opacity in CSS a standard?
 anyone here?
 Yes, I think there is opacity in CSS.
 Try Firefox.
 It's better than Internet Exploder.

 I need it to comply with IE too though
 They are openly affiliated with some foreign neo-nazi parties though, Dave

 JaXm, whats the link to your radio again?
 Sazzad: To host an online radio station you need to pay for a radio license, whcih can be quite pricey
 Jamie Lynn Spears... I would.
 Over and over.
 and then some? :D
 http://jaxmthemirc.uuuq.com/radio/index.html
 NO RADIOS ALLOWED JAXM
 :p
 Brandon: She fat

 She' pregnant retard.
 Darn, still isnt working for me JaXm 
 you dont need to be licensed to do internet radio stations
 yes you do
 Nope.
 Brandon - the shoutcast stream is off - zymic
 uhm... no you dont...
 if the songs are copyrighted, you need to have a license
 uhm
 otherwise everyone would be hosting a radio station...
 no you dont
 Pie`,  do you still want to install google gadgets on linux?
 dude... ive been doing this for years... think i would know
 http://code.google.com/p/google-gadgets-for-linux/wiki/BinaryPackages :D
 DarkKrai: Not on linux atm :(
 urgh 23.27 am already, suckss
 it works
 Pie` - http://radio.about.com/cs/forprofessionals/a/aa051104a.htm
 http://avanix.uni.cc/images/snapshot15.png
 Pie`, I used http://www.getdeb.net/release/3767
 installed it, everything is working fine :d
 DarkKrai: I already have it installed
 but i dont know how to isntall extras
 extras?
 yes
 theres like little widgets ns tuff you can add on
 I have installed some
 they work
 JaXm: That is for AM/FM radio
 not for online radio stations
 -_-
 read the last paragraph
 In addition, if you plan to set up an Internet radio station you need not worry, either. The F.C.C. does not regulate streaming audio or webcasts on the Internet.
 so wtf is the poitn in copyright laws then
 all thsi shit on youtube
 copyright on videos n crap
 even just on audio
 yet and old joe can jsut stream any song they wish to anyone in the world
 uhm it does cost to run a radio station... and without enough skill, it will go nowhere
 i mean i really dont see why your getting so upset about it, it really doesnt affect you any
 Pie is sensitive
 rofl
 leave him alone :'(
 lol have him leave my radio alone and stop telling me im wrong with stuff ive been doing for 6 years ;)

 not gir :p
 Do you need an actual sevrver

 Hey are there going to be free web templates in the future? 
 or I mean "new" free web templates...
 superman: We have some more issues at the moment
 There could be some coming though
 I myself have one not yet released to Zymix if you would like to see it
 Sure thing
 www.jacobbednarz.com/templates/GrassyKnoll/
 That should be a test version
 I really liked the Zymic templates, too bad they don't make new ones anymore as they used too :(
 There have been some added recently
 Where? The last one was added : 28.11.2008
 Template 90
 Nope.
 Have a another look
 I am :(
 For me 90 is the most recently / latest one
 Night all
 Don't let the door hit you on the way out Jacob
 Jacob (Jacob@jacobbednarz.com) Quit (Quit: <?php)
 AFternoon!
 hey Craig
 Gregors, long time no speak
 How goes it?
 okay i'm done playing in the Forum
 http://www.speedtest.net/result/522881185.png
 my internet sped up :D!
 Anyone ever hear of the Google Wave?
 Yeah, watched their expo on it, innovative, yet nothing that new.
 Ed: Nothing that new?
 It runs in your browser alone
 its absically msn, only coller imo :P
 and without the microsoft shit
 ok its really just a basic chat interface
 but its never been done on such a big scale
 Great for those who think "put it in a browser" is the solution to all ills :p
 But frankly I don't.
 It's not really that new, it's threaded chat, forums have it. It's just live and present on one page.
 Still they played their hand quite well with it ;)
 All the references to Firefly give it an automatic cult following :p
 I was just looking thru and over the Evony site and I believe they've something like what your discussing, kinda poor in make up like Alex mentioned
 put it in a browser
 I guess it could be likened to my use of frames
 Why would someone do that?
 I'm not slammin them by saying that above but I found the site a bit fustrating
 I guess there are places on the net old people just should'nt go to because of the generation gap
 like 4chan
 :D
 got an addresss handy
 BlackTie, you dont want to go there :s
 really that bad for me or because of age
 don't be afraid
 do a google search :P
 !google 4chan
 www.google.com/search?q=4chan
 http://www.4chan.org/ 4chan is the largest English imageboard on the web.
 !google /b/
 www.google.com/search?q=/b/
 http://prb.aps.org/ International journal specializing in  condensed-matter phenomena, as well as materials physics.
 wtf lies
 it used to say 4chan
 ok just reading the warning at the page explains alot japan based theme (I got fingers that can't use tiny japan made products because the buttons are so small
 What?
 lolwhut
 the warning i refer to is the opening statement
 so Knowing what I know about japanese I won't even proceed further and cause fustration for myself
 its not all about japanese stuff
 Random isnt ;)
 Oh you're talking about 4chan. Hah!
 did you read the first page top boxed in area that said it was modeled after the japan version
 tiny buttons is an analogy
 Hey
 hey
 Who is Craig ? :S
 Hello :)

 Craig = Tinkletoes Ben
 Tinklestoes hm
 Oh, hmm still don't know him lol.
 I've known Craig for years, he's one of the good guys. Js guru.
 I'm thinking of buying this http://threestore.three.co.uk/dealsummary.aspx?offercode=1MB5GD003&id=1403 but not sure how good mobile broadband is for like browing website and msn.
 Ahh I see :D
 Call him tinkletoes, he prefers that.
 Frank
 about 1.5mbit iirc
 hehe
 Yeah?
 is that bad Ed ?
 JS Guru... I like that :P
 Ben, a friend of mine has mobile broadband, and as long as you don't mind the monthly caps it's really decent
 Speeds are great, better than landlines in some instances
 Yeah krisives?
 Nothing, just accidently dragged a name
 Sorry
 Sweet I tihnk I'll get it then, and it's only 1 month contract so thats good :D
 Thanks Craig
 Plus theres the added bonus of having internet whereever theres a phone signal
 OK
 *Twinkletoes
 :P
 I only need it for when my mum turns of our internet, would be usefull for school as well save me the time using proxys.
 Indeed.
 Do you have a 3G phone Ben?
 You can usually tether it.
 Yeh I tihnk so, it's a really old one though one of the first ones.
 Probably want to check if it has the relevant protocols
 Alot of older phones aren't very good tethered... seem to use an older version of the protocols
 Although it really depends on the phone and manufacturer.
 Some contracts state you shouldn't do it too
 Benji's here!
 So is Edward!
 Hey Sazzad 
 Howdy
 I am :D
 Hey
 Hola
 Ed what do you mean by tether ?
 Hook up the phone to the laptop either through a usb cable or via bluetooth
 Erm computer
 not just laptop
 Ooh nice!! So then you can do what you want ?
 Yup, basically what the 3G sticks do
 thanks :D
 Check with your contract though :P
 hehe yeh I'm on pay as you go atm
 Haha, that'll cost a packet
 Was thinking of getting a contract, I get £30 a week for going to school when I start 6th I can use that :D
 I'm an idiot.. left my bank card in machine this morning ran back up after just getting on the bus and it was gone :( lol
 rofl :(
 I have Orange p&g and the internet is so filtered, they filter ALL forums...
 zymic.com/forum is rejected
 but you can use Opera Mobile to get around it as it works like a proxy
 :O It's banned at my school, have to use a proxy or get my IT teacher to log me in on his account.
 :/\
 Ooh sounds good!
 Do IP:PORT proxies accounts work.
 Never tried them
 But you'll need ff as most schools prevent you from getting in to IE' settings.
 You can chain proxies from the address bar Brandon
 How
 \
 Yeh our school uses IE7 now, used to be 5 till a couple of months ago
 Orange broadband filter forums :|
 Thats ridiculous 
 Orange mobile Craig 
 Oh. Well I guess thats not _as_ bad but still...
 Surely theres a way to turn it off?
 Yeah, you have to have a +18 account for it
 Aha.
 But to have that you need a credit card...
 O_o
 What does the 18+ account get you?
 ahh reminds me, my bank still haven't sent me new debit card :@
 I didn't need that for t-mobile if I used my online account
 I did if I wanted to unlock it from my phone
 Completely unfiltered I think Craig 
 Unlock what Alex?
 Content filter
 What did you think I was talking about? :P
 Star power ofc
 ^^
 A subject that is never far from my mind, but in this case, it was
 So I guess the previous assumption is proven false reductio ad absurdum
 Sorry yeah Brandon, it's something like http://ip-address:port/http://www.google.com
 Good evening
 Good morning :-P
 For you i guess xD
 Good afternoon
 Did someone just visit the Vatican Alex? ;)
 Good Afterning
 xD
 So whats up here?
 More like I've done proofs at a decent level of maths ;)
 Good afternoon fags.
 xD
 Method of proof by assuming the opposite of what you want to proove, and then finding a logical contradiction
 When you get to the end you say reductio ad aburdum :p
 It's just how it is
 Just like for a straight forward proof you often say Quod erat demonstrandum
 Learn something new every day.
 QED is a lot easier to say.
 Yes, but that's what it stands for :p
 And you don't say stuff without knowing what it is ;)
 So we know the latin as legacy really
 I mean, you could just say "this is a proof by contradiction"
 But for some reason they prefer to use latin.
 Sounds cooler. Nuf' said.
 Hi dolleh
 hey frank
 HOMG BEN :O
 OMG DOLLEH!! :O
 HOMG BEN :O
 :D
 :D
 :O
 I hate to interrupt such a stimulating conversation, but seen this stuff about ipods recently?  Amuses me, though I have to say it doesn't seem like a huge concern at the moment
 Quite a lot of reports about them getting hot enough to burn, smoking, and in a few cases setting themselves on fire :p
 But still, given the amount of devices, it's a small proportion
 Oooh never knew that!
 lol XD
 Not sure it was on the news, I got it off /.
 Oh
 Someone used the freedom of information act to get the complaints sent in to apple or somesuch
 Mine gets ridiculously hot charging
 Mine doesnt
 Laptop charger is worse though
 Agreed ^
 Ed, how do you charge yours?
 A wall charger Frank
 Ah, I charge my itouch with the computer
 I find that pretty inconvenient
 It doesnt bother me, because its a desktop computer, and its up out of the way when charging
 Lately I've been putting my ipod in standby mode, it make the battery last longer :D
 HOMFGGGG mom? home
 if I dont return, I run off or got killed :O
 shit shit shit :O

 Lozzers... just spent 10 minutes debugging CUPS finding out why the XP box wouldn't print over the LAN... it wasn't plugged in XD

 Well, I've submitted my Sandbox account request for Google Wave
 haha smoothe Craig
 A little birdy told me its going public beta in September...
 One can only hope... I sent off for my sandbox account the day the form went live and still haven't been give none :( *Sad face*
 What did you put?
 user  surveys me thinks
 shit
 forgot that
 I also sent in a Haiku, just for shits and giggles
 ah
 Craig: That was the wrong form methinks
 You need to fill out https://services.google.com/fb/forms/wavesignupfordev/
 *Re-reads your initial message* Yeah... I didn't quite catch the sand-box part, sorry :P
 :P
 I did fill out the form you did too
 put a link to some *colored* ASCII work
 trying to remember where it is
 eh I'll find it in a bit
 I wish I'd saved my Haiku... i was quite impressed with myself
 hehe
 yea I'm grep'ing for it now

 Changes an image to ASCII art
 cool
 It's not that uncommon

 Some graphics card drivers on Linux will convert media streams into ascii
 Movies from the console :p
 Your haiku Craig?
 lol
 Indeed!
 Was I ever shown this?
 Don't think so...
 I basically copied and pasted a haiku from google and adapted it with my awesomeness
 The result: Pure, omnipotent goodness
 :P
 brb
 Don't leave us Ben!
 brb...

 No
 What is the name DarkKrai?
 What do tigers dream of...
 Dark Heaven in norwegian :s
 Eating the boy from Frosties advert Craig?
 One of my friends told me that, after of course
 When they take a little tiger snooze.
 Interesting -> http://2009.full-frontal.org/
 for JS developers anyway...
 Guy looks like a hobo -> http://i37.tinypic.com/zlqlqt.jpg
 You haven't seen many speakers at programming conferences have you?
 Well, I just wanted to point that out :P
 It's not really a remarkable thing :p
 Hmm
 I mean, most notably probably
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman
 Are you attending Craig?
 I wonder if they're going to write an RFC for the wave protocol
 http://www.waveprotocol.org/draft-protocol-spec Looks like it
 No number assigned yet however
 Well, it depends how they want to standardise it.
 I imagine it'll be an API
 true
 bbs
 RFC is an IET thing
 I want to, but it's a bit expensive... plus I'd need accom plus travel tickets
 Well, most IEEE
 more*
 But those are mostly de-facto standards
 Not like the ISO process
 The other thing is that RFC = "Request for Comments", so it fits in with a conference, design by committee process
 Which I'm a bit doubtful Google will necessarily care for, they probably think they can do the lot themselves without comments :p
 But they might, if only to fit in with other protocols given standardisation in the same way
 back
 @Alex I do hope so, otherwise it'll seem like this 'Wave' protocol is the odd one out
 Most of the major protocols use RFCs, anyway
 "The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 (Bradner, S., Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels, March 1997.) [TERMS]."
 So they might use an RFC

 Hopefully they can release Google Wave before that
 Going a bit too much...but I admire the courage
 I have mixed feelings about the Wave

 Or give me the account? :P
 For?
 Oh the wave?
 Ye
 very interested in this
 We receive ours in a few week.

 The entire company does
 But I thought you had yours?
 NO my boss does

 Windows is gay, I cant run linux programs on it
 I have no choice but to use vista for design work
 Both graphic and CAD
 Programming+Coding = Fedora
 heh
 go WINE about it :P
 my bro uses Vista to run AutoCAD or w/e
 LOL
 Annoying as hell
 Winforms are shit for making effects for applications, I would use WPF forms but they are only for .Net 3.0 + framework
 It doesn't run using wine on linux
 use virtualbox :D
 and install windows in there
 Yeah but running on a 2 gig ram on the windows which i use nearly all of it
 alright rebel its transferring

 I have 2.5 gb, I need to upgrade =/
 mine is slowly becoming obsolete

 Seriously?

 Brandon doesn't like too many people
 Server I think.
 he doesn't like Pie` either
 remember him begging for his hosting back?

 Which domain are you using for the site?
 TheOracle: http://tinygrab.com/ I'm making the windows version of it
 ic
 Who me Sazzad ?
 ben, is it gonna be free?
 Tinygrab costs money but WinUp will remain free.
 ik
 *ok
 should make something like skitch!
 what is skitch?
 That like GrabUp but with editing ?
 yes
 ok
 and its free
 safe
 Ben: Aren't you going to put that in WinUp?
 it even lets you manage your screenshots on their server
 I see a disabled setting for it atm
 Yep
 :D
 I might delete some of WinUp settings, to many imo.
 http://img.skitch.com/20090722-x79281d5jnms3rw7k9ifek9wtc.png
 :O
 skitch for WinUp would be awesome
 TheOracle lemme show you something sec
 Crap...why is my computer keep on crashing

 Does that work on XP too?
 hi Dolleh 
 Only Vista.
 :P
 Damn.
 heya frank 
 Urm probs not unless xp has a glow thing like aero

 Then no it doesn't unless you get a theme.
 Ben, is that on the current winup?
 Nope thats part of the screenshot class i wrote for Tinygrab

 Sliding isnt a prebuilt effec
 I feel asleep earlier for like 10 minutes woke back up laptop say 08:00 I was like O_O shit hour half late!
 its hand coded animations
 Seems like ti was 8PM lol. I felt like a retard jumping up to get ready for work at that time xD
 just using a timer to resize windows
 Yeh thats what I do Tim it works with every control well except the Tab control which is lags, pissing me off =[

 YES!!!

 ...just saying
 Who does anything for a specific platform these days
 Silly people
 :O
 Ahh its so convenient living in a pub when i go to my dads.
 that must be awesome
 is it a nice pub, or a good ol' country pub ?
 Doesn't really sound it.  A lot of pubs kick out around 1am, so you've got drunk people around until a bit after then
 I'd rather have the pub within easy walking distance :p
 Urm not sure, it's in a village.
 You're not sure it's a nice pub?
 If that's the case it probably isn't ;)
 Well he said nice pub or good ol' country pub, I would say both its country looking but nice.
 A lot of city pubs are country looking on the inside
 So I would say the question was a bit lacking :p
 Implying mutual exclusivity, anyways
 is it full of beardy drunk men all the time
 What've you got on tap?  That's one of the important things
 or do the 'lads' come in?
 hehe, we have a whole fridge of Becks pepople like that.
 Lesbian
 Not really many lads Pie`
 Yes there are two lesbians that come in on friday and saturday

 Alex: The screen command in linux
 does ti like, create another terminal window
 and you can swtch back to it whenever
 Not that basic, that's just TTY's
 It's a terminal emulator / window manger / terminal multiplexor
 The 275ml bottles, Ben?  Bleh
 Can't be bothering with that, pints :p
 I take it from you not wanting to tell me that you've got Carling/Fosters or some other pisswater on tap? ;)
 Yep
 Hehe yes we have that in the kegs =[
 fosters aint too bad...
 carlsburg is brewed about 15 miles from where i live :P
 You won't find much support for that statement here, JaXm :p
 lol
 i love stella artois
 I had the advert for it.
 Carlsberg export is not too bad.
 Regular stuff, I'd rather not :p
 john smiths is horrible the next morning...
 You more of a carlsburg guy Alex ?
 a truly amazing song
 I just said I don't drink the regular carlsberg, Ben ;)
 oops didn't see that.
 Strongbow
 Bleh, I'll drink it but only if there's no other cider available
 ewww
 :O
 Some Westons or Kopparberg or Bulmers
 oh... whats that wine over there, Lambrini is it?
 Kopparberg not really the normal cider, I ger the pear or summer fruit when it's summer ;)
 the stuff all the chavs buy and get drunk off half the bottle
 Dunno, I don't keep contact with many (read: any) chavs :p
 heh chavs don't really drink wine, here anyway
 Hello all
 Hey Robert
 ah, they did where i lived... doesnt matter if you wanted to be in contact with them... ya see em everywhere
 I've had a fun day...
 I need to close stuff, my email client is complaining
 back in a bit
 Nah were not really wine drinker in windsor
 :O
 ah i was up near newcastle in county durham
 Hmm not sure if I should look forward to results day or not.
 Which results day, GCSE?
 Yep
 Bleh, as long as you get 5 A*-C it doesn't really matter :p
 wait... how old are you guys?
 I'm 16.
 He's a young-un :p
 I'm 19
 oh lmao
 i was thinking... talking about pubs and beer... and then about your GCSE results...
 Yeh Alex Iv already got 2 A*'s, B and a C (Had to take foundation maths early, did higher in the summer).
 This is why Ben doesn't know much about decent stock, JaXm ;)
 Wb robert
 hahaha
 haha
 Turns out thunderbird's just being stupid
 i left the uk when i was 20
 I had my first Becks the other day from a can :O
 it can wait for the nightly restart
 hehe
 A C, Ben?  Fail ;)
 had some good times there... had alot of bad times with the chavs though :/
 I never had trouble avoiding them
 hehe nope ;-)
 lol well they didnt like me cuz im american
 See if you get a long with the chavs its all good :D
 and turns out when we moved there... we moved into one of the roughest neighborhoods
 Ah, so you were over here for the more lenient buying age ;)
 nah, my mom met someone online and hooked up with him
 I have no issue with most Americans, I know a fair few
 they still together too, own a house and everything =]
 Had two living with me last year at uni :p
 But they were only doing the one year, so they're back now
 lol well where i grew up... you dont beat on 1 guy on the ground with 12 people -_-
 Alex your going away soon aren't you ?
 No?
 Greece ?
 Was a while ago
 oh my bad.
 And I couldn't get anything for migraines in time for it anyways, so I ended up missing it.
 Typical to get a big patch of them right around then
 2 and a half weeks of nightly migraines :p
 Ahh that sucks =[
 Still nowhere near as bad as last summer
 So there's an upside
 Had migraines last summer as well ?
 Yes, that was when the problem started really.
 Around the time I ended up having an MRI, and a prescription for about two months :p
 Because I'd had a month of bad nightly migraines, throwing up every half hour almost every night.
 Ooh sounds bad :(
 Still, it does do something useful
 ^ I agree D:
 poor alex
 migraine sucks
 I now consider just a headache no reason to stop doing whatever it is I'm up to :p
 The pyrophoric warhead of the AIM9-L is a fearsome piece of engineering. It has a blast/fragmentation action, which produces a large pattern of high-speed fragments that make mincemeat of airframe and engine components alike. A few nanoseconds later, a disc of zirconium is detonated, which becomes a circular, fan-shaped pattern of white-hot metal scorching through the debris. This normally results in a catastrophic and instantaneous explosion. Very few fighter aircraft have ever survived an AIM9-L hit.
 thats one kickass missile
 I never let a headache stop me from doing whatever it was :P I just ignore it most of the time XD
 Including going to a gig or something? :p
 well, I never went to a gig in my life yet :P
 but do shows on stage count? as in, i'm on the stage? XD
 with headache, lol
 I've been to many a gig :P
 I can't wait for 2012
 the best gig in all of hstory is goignt o take palce
 well, best tour
 2012 olympics
 no ;)
 =[
 Don't remind me :p
 the System of a down reunion tour 
 And that's hardly a tour ;)
 :}
 Don't you like them Alex /
 I some how don't think it will be nearly as good as the last ones.
 Can't say I do
 Well, I could, lies are sometimes hard to spot ;)
 Ther performances that china put on were sick though.
 Exactly
 Ours is going to be squallid by comparison :p
 ours is going to be good ol' english style
 Yeh
 a couple of fireworks and a 'hooray the olympics hve started'
 squalid*
 I would rather we didn't have it really
 So that we didn't have to pay for it
 The costs have gotten ridiculous
 Inordinate even.
 Yeh, we studied it on geography.
 Pie` you from uk ?
 sure am
 epic country sint it? ;)
 isn't 8
 Oh didn't know that, it sure is!!
 :p
 Best country in the world if you ask me. 8-)
 ^ +1
 +1
 Damn it, wheres Ed gone >.>
 Orly.
 we used rule mot of the world anyway
 most *
 :p
 and australia / nz still bow down to us :p
 stupid americans and their declaration of indepenadace -_-
 I wish I concentrated more in school now. =[
 I need to
 i got a G in my mock GCSE's
 :S
 Lmao
 What subject ?
 Ben, that's not funny.
 english
 I got a U in ICT :)
 I got an S in history though ^_^
 haha
 Lies
 Pie`: aye, we just taxed them a bit for tea and protected them from the French :p
 I <3 History
 Me? Lies. No.
 Ben: Join the club
 Argh guys, seeya 'round ^^
 Brandon you really get a U ?
 bye Niintek
 And then they only managed to win the war by going to the French and getting them to attack us at the same time
 Seeya 'round mate ;]
 Ben yes
 haha how come ?
 bye Niintek !
 hey all
 Ciao!
 hey TheOracle !
 Only because they are retard technicians and banned me from network and internet so unable to do anything.
 SP has gone!
 Doesn't matter though. The ICT lesson was shit :(
 haha lame, my friend got banned from it because he was on command prompt.
 Brandon: You see when they do that
 what you do is use someone else's user accuont to inject your own registry keys into the server :p
 That's what i did :D
 only works though if your technicians are retards and running a windwos server
 Pie`: Your school obviously has insane shitty security.
 Brandon: Tru dat
 This is true of most school setups
 they disabled running .bat files, but not if you stick then in a zip folder
 and you can't run command prompt, but you can run COMMAND.COM
 It's a government initiative that all schools have to have them, but they don't give them any extra budget for full-time experienced IT staff
 I managed to run .bat file from desktop to open shit loads of files. Apparently they called it a virus :p
 hmm
 I put high resolution on (Alth + Shift + prnt srcn) and was told i had to put teh desktop back how it was or recieve a week fo detentions
 They're rolling out stuff for secondary schools at the moment, to start next year I think, they all have to have a web accessible panel for parents to check pupils progress
 Their kids only
 we have something like that
 edline
 So that needs to be secured as well, secondary schools are not too bothered, they can afford someone to look after it
 Hah what we do is go into the a hdd called student save, where students can save work for others to see (thousands of files) press ctrl + A and enter people get annyoed when the computer crashes xD
 Alex: Our school servers are proper locked down but if you have some knowledge of networking then you'll have your ways to explore the full network of which I did :p
 you can get otno my schools network from home, but its only possible if you're doing it form Ie
 otherwise it just keeps prompting you for a password
 But there's a later deadline for Junior and then infant schools
 TSweb by any chance, Pie`?
 no
 And they don't have /any/ full-time IT staff typically
 So that's going to be fun for them
 Can't remember what it is
 Meh, VLE then
 we use VLE for some things
 haha Alex
 but not to access our student files etc on the school network
 VLE = Virtual Learning Environment.
 You can't access the files or you can, Pie`? :/
 can, but only in IE
 :P
 rofl
 NaRzY: Brandon didn't do it
 Hey Narz

 Are you being serious? 
 As in it is a IRC issue?
 Hi NaRzY

 Your WP?
 getting to it. 
 <3 H2G2
 He can't decide who to be today
 Our server fell over last night
 So I have been on that
 But it will only take like 1 hour max once I start it
 Hah... what is the saying towards that? :p
 Brandon: Is that at me?
 Paranoid? :o
 :o
 Very much so I think
 Nah, I just thought you were taking the piss out of the work server
 Indeed :-P
 (s)
 He's avoiding the FBI by changing names every second
 How can you take the piss out of a server muppet :p
 Who pissed in a server?

 WTF wordpress? I just upgraded you
 How can you have another update?
 Www.yankele.co.il/404.htm, what do you think?
 bit much for a 404 page :P
 javascript on 404 ewwww
 Not so biggy.
 :P.
 It'll be a multilang site, and it's the best way I found (or the least ugly way) to display the message in 3 languages.
 why not jsut dispaly the 3 languaes frist off?
 That's silly
 or jsut write, '404 error - page not found' on the site
 Why display any at all?>
 Or WTF!~You broke it
 Lol :P.
 It's just that it may be used by people who don't know what 404/don't speak anything but their native language.
 that's their problem, not yours :P
 They broke it
 They should fix it
 either learn the lingo, or translate it
 I wish !kb could be used in real life. It would solve so many problems at work
 Pie` - not really, since they are potential customers, it's my problem
 Jacob - lol yeah, teleport them out of the building and place an invisible barriar only matching to their DNA xD
 but it's their problem they got the 404 error(Providing your site is written well) and their problem they can't read it
 That's the plan
 And I can /mode +b on their arse too
 Pie` - of course it's their fault for reaching the page, but if they did get to the page, I want them to know wtf is wrong, and not let them guess :D
 Guessing is fun
 You get some wierd replies
 I've drunk 2 litres fo lemonade today
 I've only beena way 36 minutes

 BBC NEWS | Health | Call to close schools to curb flu
 that's jsut goign to make the problem worse....
 YEAH
 but ti acctually will
 because instead of the kids being in school where it could spread from student to student
 the children will be at home bored with nothing to do, and go outside
 where there is more chance of it being spread
 Bored go outside, burn some cars
 catch swine flu
 :-P
 Only where you live, Ed :P
 Poor poor Ed...

 thats not good
 my irc client allows me to have a pm with myself
 Robert: Same
 more stupidly, the irc spec makes the server allow this to happen
 surely it should stop people pming themselves?
 im thinking they assume people wouldn't :P
 my web is died
 help me
 Sometimes you get more sense out of yourself than anyone else, so I see nothing wrong with it ;)
 tayson.vndv.com
 Tayson: Please join #hosting
 It would be a way to spam the server with no one knowing
 it would just go very slowly
 but Ed: Talking you yourself on irc would be like talking to a child imitating you?
 thank
 because whatever you say is mirrored back to you
 Hello
 speak of the devil
 :s
 incoming shitstorm
 rofl
 Cr`eme: I heard you hated us all ?

 Heh, well SOME people are childish on here Pie`, so no real change ;)
 Cr`eme is a celebrity now
 everyone knows who Cr`eme is
 hes actually, INfamous :s
 I don't
 lol
 he'd only just started coming when I left a month ago
 Lucky Robert ;)
 So I've missed it all

 TheOracle what does pyDelphi do again?
 pydelphi ghosts Creme and `iqbal
 Nah

 Cr`eme: That's what you think ;)
 Robert: http://delphi.wikimetru.com/#pyDelphi

 <@avanix> I got Google Gadgets to work in Kubuntu, yays http://bit.ly/oFboh (http://twitter.com/avanix/statuses/2765631342)
 Takes a bit sometimes
 I know :p
 just in testing atm
 Good for you...?
 I don't think I have big enough tear ducts for crying babies
 Ugh I want my Google Wave account ;_;
 oh damn
 TheOracle: Who are you saying "Good for you...?" to?
 Robert, Brandon :S
 Heh, I thought as much.
 :/
 I wish you could shift around columns in a MySQL tabel
 *table
 It'll be on sBot in a bit
 Ed: I think SQL Buddy can do that
 I'll check it out TheOracle, thanks
 What is google wave?
 annoyed with dropping the columns then recreating them
 !google google wave
 www.google.com/search?q=google+wave
 Google it Cr`eme
 http://wave.google.com/ Google Wave is a new online communication  and collaboration tool.
 nm
 Robert: I have something like that
 @g Google Wave
 TheOracle: http://wave.google.com/
 No link to search results as of yet
 I have something like that
 Google "google wave" Ed
 the search results page is the easy half
 Okay... one moment.
 Yea
 I can do that right now actually
 http://www.google.com/search?client=opera&rls=en-GB&q=Google+Wave&sourceid=opera&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8
 O_o
 to find the q var in any string
 http://code.google.com/apis/wave/guide.html
 who made pyDelphi ?
 TheOracle did 
 Yea
 Using a framework
 How did you get the frink calculator working? :P
 because frink is mainly done in java
 TheOracle what was the frame?
 Phenny i think ?
 Yea
 I tried to make one from scratch but there were far too many problems
 I couldn't find an IRC module anyway
 TheOracle: How did you add thef rink calculator ?
 the frink *
 That was one of the builtin features Pie`
 oh
 I could pull some code if you like
 Kay
 It relies on the rest of the code however
 Anyone here knows some photoshop?
 so you'll have to change a lot
 http://pastesite.com/9019/phenny
 Doesn't look like it can TheOracle (sqlbuddy)
 Sure?
 I tried it before
 hold on
 I couldn't see it
 ah
 It can change the width, not the position
 my bad
 :P I'll let you off
 <:D
 I think the frink site just went down -_-
 or my itnernet is being a whore again
 ah tis back again
 :/
 the urlencode() function in php turns things like + into %2B ?
 @o php urlencode
 PHP Function Lookup: urlencode [PHP 3, PHP 4, PHP 5] http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.urlencode string urlencode ( string str ) >>URL-encodes string
 There's your answer.
 :O
 yeah but what is a url encoded string? XD
 A URL with characters that are escapped
 like %20, which is a space
 yes it does what i said
 :d
 Pie` releated to Cr`eme?
 no?
 j/k
 krisives never
 (bad name joke)
 Brandon? :/
 :P
 oh damnit ur here
 Dave?
 :P
 Cr`eme
 leaving a load of channels ? :p
 How long have NOT been banned?
 So?
 ?
 like 2 - 3 days krisives
 3*
 Did you find some other servers to get banned from to fill the void, or just quitting cold turkey?
 Lol
 Anyone use Camtasia?
 Yes I did
 It is better then CamStudio :p
 Lol Look at this http://pastesite.com/9021
 LAME
 :/
 I wish the implode function for php let you have an ignore argument
 pissing off people as soon as you return isnt wise, Cr`eme
 so you could like skip he first value etc
 ;o
 Dolleh :o
 :O
 Write a custom one Pie`?
 Heya Dolleh 
 hey mr ed :D
 Ed: I have a way around it, i just wish it were easier :D
 Ed: http://pastesite.com/9022
 I wanted to skip first value in the array
 Missing a ';' Pie` 
 ben :O
 M$ can suck it, I got Office in WINE now! :o
 ah yes, thank you Ed :P
 also, why starting at 2?
 Surely should start at 1
 I'm not a pest Ed :(
 otherwise you skip the first two
 SOlleh :O
 Dolleh*
 DarkKrai: What's wrong with open office ?
 :s nothing
 How is Miss Dolleh this evening? 
 cant even type my name.... pfft i? insulted ben D:
 just felt like downloading 500mb and seeding it xD
 Ed: Because i do that sometimes and add the extra pieces of the array along with " "
 and I didn't do that this time :P
 she? okay-ish mr ed
 Ahh sorry Dolleh I cut my finger :(
 D:
 so did I :O
 I'd bundle it into a function and have $skip as an offset, but check it doesn't exceed the length of the array ;)
 Brandon you called ?
 No? :/
 You said "Hello" :/
 :S
 My phone isn't even on.
 lies brandon, you just wanted to hear ben? voice huh?
 Lies it came up "Brandon New calling"

 You are So Cool! pffft
 Both of you
 Shut up

 ND ARGUE IN pmS
 ^
 oh no, cant pm
 Tell DarkKrai to stop and then I wil stop

 considering you comment on everything I say, that doesnt make sense
 now shut up.
 Meeso: Don't tell him that.
 tired of your shit :s
 You're putting gasoline on the fire
 You ass
 ^
 If he cant be mature enough to handle it why is he here
 Both of you, really
 You keep getting each other even angrier
 Just SHUT UP!
 Really guys...
 grow up ?
 They can't.
 They're obviously little idiots that keep slapping eachother
 :P
 For no good reason whatsoever
 Hey I dont get PMs About people calling me a shitstorm and a badass
 ...
 This is what I'm talking about
 Just stop
 If he stops I will too
 Stop right now, and never start again
 You'll both be muted for a period if you can't be nice to each other.
 you'll do all of us a favor
 Dave I have been muted enough and even glined for shit. When I stop he fucking starts. Geesh
 Ok well it's finished now. Change the topic.
 SHUTUP NOW
 Dave: Not so fast apparently :/
 No Dolle
 Me too
 hands up for muting?!
 * Added DarkKrai!*@* to ignore list
 :P
 I'll back it, including stopping evasion by revoicing if DarkKrai still wants to get involved, but I think he's done :)
 Uh, no.
 Its both of your guy's fault.
 Its like, I cant talk because eveything I say, he says something, I respond, you guys complain about him, his ill reasoning that just makes him argue even more. Its unfair that everytime that I speak, he has something to say about it.
 What you should really do is ignore eachother
 I suggested it to him
 he refuses to
 Nope, Alex
 Or maybe not
 Not anymore :S
 It was just taking a long time to type all that I guess
 I did ignore him. It is his turn. You see I dont give a shite of what he does. He could even make fucking shit about that isnt true.
 I dont have time either. To deal with a 14 year old.
 You're both at fault. DarkKrai, you were winding him up as soon as he returned.
 Now leave it.
 So new topic
 What dave said is true. The second I came. Oh No the shitstorm came.
 cmon shit, this aint a daycare
 How's the weather where you are, Dave? ;)
 SHUTUP NOW MKEY
 Nice again now, Alex :) blue sky has returned
 Dolle dont tlell me what to do
 how about you? :p
 Still cloudy, rained for a bit not long ago
 :s
 Cr`eme how about you calm down for a bit, ok.
 Its nice over here. We were expecting rain, but it never came.
 TheOracle, youre in fl right?
 Nope.
 we had rain all day D: ugh
 Indiana
 Andrew lives in Florida
 oh D:
 xD
 We had a huge downpour at about 3, Alex.. I guess that's what you're getting now? :p
 It looked nasty, too.
 It was quite heavy rain, but it didn't last long
 Just never happened.
 Oh no.. rain is moving NE the weather tells me :p
 So I'll probably get that soon!
 D:
 Poor Dave
 Have fun with my rain. :O
 Well it's quite a distance for /your/ rain to travel :p
 true.
 :O!
 lol
 Nice Alex.
 :P
 :/
 Sorry Dave
 Behave now ;)
 ok
 Oh
 I dont feel like finishing quixdraw today
 I am so tired.
 It was all that yelling.
 And QuixDraw is a hard project
 I dont feel like walking to the horses no more D: my legs will fall of
 off*
 I'm sure you tore something.
 Who thinks norton sucks?
 Oh. Meeso. What happened to your 'cool' backslash in your nick?
 :P
 TheOracle ?
 Dave ?
 Blackslash / nick? :/

 OH right
 How did it go?
 It was lame.

 Ben :io
 BEN!

 hey Ben
 Hi
 Hmm
 @o twitter sroracle
 <@sroracle> @YummyCocoa @tmdvs the next project should be a Google Wave app. :O (http://twitter.com/sroracle/statuses/2801556279)
 Hey TheOracle
 I think its a great idea.
 :O
 eww wtf
 http://i36.tinypic.com/33b0g87.jpg
 It does that fairly often
 I find
 I know.
 And its god damn annoying.
 Twitter does that to me too :S
 It only does that when I'm downloading *cough* 'legal' torrents *cough*
 but, thats because I set it to high bandwidth usage
 hey outlet
 hey
 hihi outlet 
 ...
 mmmm
 I want Google Wave sooooooooooo bad :S

 i was here yesterday chill out...
 I did not see you :O
 so let me go :O if I want to mkey :D

 Sazzad you there?
 omg
 my internet has jsut hit its fastest in like
 3 months
 0.76mbps dl :D
 Sazzad?
 bbl
 hey Brandon
 dronix was looking for ya last night
 Why?
 he just told us to tell you he was looking for you
 Why did you not tell me then, Dolleh? :o
 And if I can see from logs, since then at around 5 today, he asked Brandon if he minded a PM
 So about three hours ago, did that not get through?
 Nope
 I thougth somebody already told you that by now D:
 Dolleh: It would have been safer to tell him anyway
 even fi someonealready did :P
 woo
 my internet is getting faster by the minute 8D
 its now up to 0.80mbps
 dl
 Blazing speed
 If the "m" was a "g".
 Alex: Not too long ago it was 0.15mbps
 :D
 so its a big improvement for me
 That's true
 Still not quite what you want for streaming media :p
 Does you fine for most else I'd imagine
 Do .ico files support transparency ?
 I get 3 - 4mbps during the winter
 Ben: Yes
 Does it matter?  Make a .png as well :p
 Ok thanks, does anyone know a decent png to ico converter? I can't find a good one :/
 Compliant browsers will follow a <link> over /favicon.ico
 So I put a favicon.ico in place for legacy browsers that are broken, and point compliant browsers to a PNG
 ahh im not using this for website, the notify icon control in c# only supports .ico files.
 Oh right, this being a web dev community and all I assumed :p
 Anyways, I've used GIMP to make them before
 Yeh my bad :( I used to have a good converter can't fidn it now.
 ooh i have gimp
 Takes long to load :/
 not as long as photoshop cs4
 :D
 but cs2 > *
 I have cs4
 Photoshop is quite nice, but what do you expect, it's the same old thing ;)
 Photoshop is built with Qt, and GIMP obviously originated the GTK+ toolkit.
 The Qt one is clearly going to be a bit nicer :p
 but photoshop(legally) is like £300 ?
 Photoshop used Qt :O never knew that.
 GIMP is 100% free
 so what do you expect
 I don't really equate things that way, I prefer to use a lot of free software to expensive alternatives
 But if I had the money, I'd probably buy PS over gimp
 http://www.qtsoftware.com/qt-in-use/story/app/adobe-photoshop-album for example, Ben :p
 Old screenshot, they haven't updated that one since it moved to the new website
 what is Qt ?
 Ooh nice
 a toolkit
 What should I select out of the list ? http://ben.zymic.com/Grabs/U5d.png
 lalala
 I liked the way Pixel _was_ going
 I don't like how gimp has different windows. Should all be in 1 like photoshop.
 http://www.kanzelsberger.com/pixel/?page_id=12 I bought it too, but it hasn't been dev'd much
 Oooh looks like photoshop a bit
 ms paint ftw mkey
 :p
 off on the broken bike
 challange!
 bye Dolleh
 Yeah really similar to photoshop Ben, just reinstalled it, see if I can get used to it
 Sweet
 im gonna try it :)
 elloooo
 Heya Greg
 i wouldnt go in the toilet for at least 3 hrs if i were you
 Thanks for sharing that ;-)
 my stomach hurts :(
 i blame ed

 Wait we have a Trice and a Greg :O
 greg is at home. Trice is at work.
 split personalities
 Ahh I see :)
 Reinstalled Pixel trice, working on that catalogue, you?
 I like Trice
 You at work?
 Did you get Rob and Laura involved with Rob and Laura's game?
 erm
 Did YOU get involved with it I was trying to say.
 involved with what
 betting whether or not you'd answer your phone :P
 when?
 about 30mins ago :P
 that phones in my bag
 i usually get texts and the usual reply is 'work...'
 :P
 as im usually invited to cinema or something when i have woek
 work
 Bezier curve tool isn't bad in Pixel
 why phone or text me? 
 ed ed ed
 Buying it Ben?
 Not now going to try it out first :D
 ed what were they phoning or texting me for??
 phoning, playing a silly game Trice
 There's a demo version Ben?
 ohh no real reason then
 No :-p
 slut
 back to bog for me bye
 urm not sure i just clicked download
 Yeh it's the demo version http://ben.zymic.com/KdI.png
 aah
 It just crashed on me said "Access violation" I was only typing text :/
 That's a good start :P
 haha yeh
 So much more usable than The GImp
 Oooh my squares come with a pattern http://ben.zymic.com/kcW.png xD
 :P
 Nice ui I like it.
 Does it look the same on linux Ed ?
 did you know
 3^100 is
 515377520732011331036461129765621272702107522001
 true story
 Ben, http://bread.uuuq.com/yupben.png
 looks a lot like photoshop
 No pen tool though Pie
 haha nice Ed looks the same :D
 I wonder if anyone has made an image host which puts the images into a sql db as BLOB data
 because surely it would cut down on bandwidth, and images would load quicker?
 Bad idea, increases database size, increases load on database, inevitably slows down the database
 :O
 4 of them :D
 DOlleh food = share
 I know!
 want some? :P
 I like pixel Ed xD
 Yes please :)
 whatever it is, its has awesome name, me likes XD
 Not too bad is it Ben!

 Ben
 Brandon: "But the used is $2,500"
 Tim

 Chris really likes working with you BTW

 Sorry Ben, you're too young

 Twat.
 I think it's time for me to get back to work and leave this conversation to you guys
 insead of $this->foo->bar("foo", bar");   it becomes [[this foo] paramName:foo paramName2:bar];
 that sounds complicated
 whell paramName whould be bar
 What does that do Tim ? (Don't know php)
 thats a typical oo call
 objects
 methods
 like you know $foo = new bar();   $foo->SomeFunctionInBarClass();
 $this means this class
 ahh
 paramName isn't a declared type Tim?
 ed basicaly in Objc params have names
 so the method definition would be like - (void)setNick:(NSString *)nickname forUser:(NSString *)user;    so the call would be [object setNick:@"Tim" forUser:@"TimDavies"];
 in php the definition would be setNick($nick, $user)
 I don't think I'll ever believe this is more elegant syntax
 I'm in agreement, it's rather revolting.
 I even prefer the look of lisp derived over this ;)
 I <3 it
 http://tmdvs.me/post/uikit-alert-types
 haha
 some really good example
 Of the horror it entails, yes :p
 What was wrong with C / C++ syntax
 Looks like an attempt to solve a problem which was non-existent.
 I like C# :D
 Ed its just apple trying to be cool
 C# isn't that bad, I like the dev speeds in it.
 No idea why the comissioned Objc
 but there is now objj
 :D
 Java I'm guessing? :P
 yes
 Yes, C# as a language is not too bad, it's the close connection to .NET et al that keeps me definitely away from it.
 That said, once I'm working I don't get to pick what I use any more really.
 So there's plenty of time for that.
 What would you prefer to use? C++ ?
 Or does it depend on the job.
 my bros famous :D
 Well, yeah, I'm unlikely to write a webpage in C++ (I could, but no thanks, too much effort :p)
 haha
 look up Justin Belber
 Or if I'm writing a quick system admin thing, it'll probably be a bash script ;)
 But for cross-platform GUI stuff, you cannot beat C++/Qt
 bash? I thought it was batch?
 look at my bro http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-qQdw7Xpv4
 Batch scripts haven't really existed for ages, since batch systems died out
 YouTube - Justin Bieber - One Time -- Rated 4.5 Stars
 :D
 There might still be a few around the place
 Probably in the financial industry if anything
 But general computing has pretty much left it in the dust.
 CSS_Guru: This video is not available in your country due to copyright restrictions.
 wat ?
 oo well
 wikipedia?
 You could get batch files for DOS, but DOS doesn't exist really any more either, and they weren't really batch even then.
 are batch files the ones with .bat extention ?
 Before NT, yeah.
 It's not what they recommend calling that kind of thing now.
 But well, then they took out DOS, and made it just an emulation :p
 Ahh I remember you saying about that before.

 That was about 3 years ago
 Well
 They changed some computer settings
 Its worked fine for me so far
 What do you use then?
 You try Norton 360? It's not good, but it's not bad either
 No thanks. We had Norton before. I...don't think I want to go back to it
 :o I want wave
 :/
 Great
 Well it is cool. So dont blame me
 :P
 Too late :S
 :o TheOracle  hates me
 Yes.
 I do.
 I personally like Webroot

 webroot?

 Cr`eme have you watched the Matrix?

 no
 Webroot is a good protection software
 The Matrix is win
 ok
 I will try to see it.
 It's the same oracle from the movie
 Possibly. :O
 Except I don't have a vagina.
 :D
 LIES TO :O
 What do people do with product sources?
 because I never used it
 ouch D:
 YOU KNOW BETTER THAN HAT PERRA >:O
 Cr`eme you can encryt it
 Hat...?
 Aww damn :(
 Ahh bad TheOracle!
 encryt ? ben
 This keyboard sucks sometimes
 SHIT!
 on*
 what source are you trying to protect ?
 Html, php, c#, javascript what ?
 I saw 'Wave' in one of the subjects in my inbox.
 Dev c++
 Its just Twitter
 :/
 Damn you 'Google Wave Info'!
 uh... Ben it is dev c++ source
 dunno then
 Well, what's the situation?
 Man I am soo damn hungry
 ok
 If someone's paid you to write bespoke software then, give them the source
 People wouldn't get the soruce anyway would that if it was compiled? Unless they reversed it or something.
 If you're producing something to be sold you can mangle the names and then compile
 But C++ generally mangles names in the compile process for efficiency reasons anyway
 s/C++/C++ compilers/
 And you can decompile things, Ben.  To an extent, but you don't get things like identifiers back
 So it's not easy to work with
 someone told me this was music: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TH5ibABP4U
 ahh ok
 YouTube - Brokencyde - Freaxxx (Official Video) -- Rated 3.0 Stars
 Alex, is it possible to compile c and c# codes in a c++ compiler?
 If it is possible
 Cr`eme: I wouldn't have thought so
 as a C++ compiler would be compiling a C++ script
 in C++ synta
 :P Because I dont know any c and c# compilers
 Cr`eme: no
 gcc should do it?
 oh ok
 Some compiler collections will allow it
 gcc for example :p
 Because gcc implements all of C99, which is not required by the C++ standard
 C++ doesn't include all of C
 Cr`eme visual studios c# has a built in compiler.
 And it certainly doesn't include that much of C#
 thank you ben
 If you want it http://www.microsoft.com/express/vcsharp/Default.aspx
 But of course if you're going to be compiling C with GCC
 Then you use gcc, not g++, which is the way you'd compile C++ with it
 Pie`: that is music:p
 I want to code something in c# or c. but I havent decided
 They're really quite different, so it's weird that you're debating those two
 Nobody cares, Cr`eme :)
 :(
 C is harder that c#
 ok then I might use c#
 omg why does the installation take long?
 But given that you *cough* know C++ really well, C is a touch easier than that
 haha
 I mean, with C++ you need to understand all about generics, the whole C++ standard library
 ;)
 I never said I know it "WELL" I know the basics. 
 Must have taken you some time that
 Cr`eme: It instally ALOT of stuff and the correct framework if you don't know it
 !rq Cr`eme
 Cr`eme has not been quoted
 :o
 no
 There was a quote where you said you know C++ very well
 really. But I know the basics. 
 This is a new quote file
 Nothing major
 Won't be there
 Ben, have you ever made a Browser with visual studios? I heard people do. 
 http://typol.co.uk/Grabs/HiA.png
 :P lol
 hey Lenny 
 Ok, well, let's think of something easy then.  Make a function that returns the set of integers delimeted by a start and stop integer.
 Cr`eme: No I haven't found the need to, Id rather use FireFox or chrome plus the browsers people make in c#, vb, vb.net etc... they use IE
 eww
 ^
 Hint: if you want to use the C method and use array you'll need to use pointers
 Cr`eme: You struggle putitng basic HTML together, how are you planning on accomplishing C++ or C#?
 But you won't, given you know C++
 :o I cant live anymore. 
 I need some substenance.
 ?
 Why can't you live Cr`eme ?
 Many reasons :P
 Nevermind. I have to eat lunch soon anyway.
 Are you going to make that function for Alex Cr`eme ?
 huh? What does alex have to do with me not being able to live anymore?
 O_o
 No he asked you something.
 <Alex>Ok, well, let's think of something easy then.  Make a function that returns the set of integers delimeted by a start and stop integer.
 Oh. I forgot about that :P.
 I will try
 Dammit, How do I get out of archived view in IPB?
 Click the full version link
 View full version: blah blah blah
 in the index
 why isnt IPBOARDS not allowed with zymic host?
 mode=linear
 Because most people will use illegal ones
 Sazzad: In the URL bar
 oh
 Cr`eme can I see the games you have made in c++ please ?
 does it say mode=linear?
 Hey Sync`
 I have only made a tictacto
 and a number averager
 hey TheOracle 
 send me it
 but hold on
 Nop
 What is the URL?

 sazzad
 On the top
 O_o
 http://www.zymic.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=18979
 That is normal
 No not for me
 Did my link work?
 I think I know how to fix it
 No jacob
 You need to change the mode to linear
 ONe sec
 I will link it up
 http://www.zymic.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=18979&start=0&#entry100497&mode=linear

 Try mine
 Thats what I just did
 That will do the topic
 Funny thing is I did add, but it's not working
 Hmm
 screeny?
 gah... stupid dev c++
 Use CodeBlocks xD
 Hah that's funny
 I believe it's a user error Cr`eme 
 The browser wouldn't take & but took &amp;
 that shouldn't work at all
 I wrote a tictactoe in C++ once, two or three years ago
 No it isnt Jacob 
 o_O
 What browser are you using?
 I can't remember why, but I think I was trying to prove it would take less than 30 minutes
 Firefox
 3.5.1
 lol alex
 haha alex
 When you run it it says "Tic-Tac-Toe - The bodged work of half an hour" then goes into the game
 So I assume that was something to do with it
 link ?
 Oh, but I'm waiting for Cr`eme's :p
 I'll post it in another channel
 ahh ok
 :P If only my compiler is working. Alex what compiler do you use?
 I use dev c++
 That's an IDE not a compiler
 And we want the source, Cr`eme, though examples of it working would help I guess
 oh
 ok
 Brb Lunch time 
 Having a break Cr`eme? Don't forget your kit kat
 It's taking that long to pastesite one file?
 rofl
 I thought yall wanted the .exe file
 That's not the source
 gahh.. Complication
 The .exe unsurprisingly is called a binary or an /executable/ ;)
 The source would be your .cpp or whatever file.
 The extension varies from IDE to IDE, and doesn't really matter to the compiler
 .cxx is also common
 Cr`eme
 :O

 You mean we have to have you back Ben?

 Why is visual studios taking so long?
 Because it hates you.
 What doesnt ? :P
 is it posssible to thread php scripts ?
 Yes, but it's a pain
 it's not full threading either
 mmk
 might hop back to linux in a minute
 Ah
 I want to test out my new kubunt
 u*
 I've got ubuntu :p
 Jacob: I have Kubuntu too :O
 although its through Wubi
 and its 8.10 :P
 I has the new version
 ew Wubi
 yea
 I tried isntalling Xubuntu through Wubi
 I cba to update it
 it didn't work :>
 now i have 3 bootloaders on my pc

 Heyyy :)
 Dave
 What do you actually do?
 Huhm? :o
 Job
 At work
 He is a rent boy
 Oh right.. 
 Yeh as Ben said ;)
 ;-)
 My shift starts around 9pm ... Ben is my first call of course
 lmao
 Which job Jacob... where I was today you mean?
 I dunno.
 Lol.
 :P
 Well .. I'm at uni so during term time my two jobs are a piano / music teacher and a front of house manager at a concert hall
 when it's the holidays, like now...
 I'm a music assistant at a school sometimes and then full time work at a computer place doing repairs, builds, sales, web design, all sorts really
 (that's where I was today).. fixing some PCs :p
 Besides script/iframe, what are some good HTML tags to blacklist?
 coolies dave
 PHP tags :P
 So, Cr`eme did you paste that tictactoe game?
 which is both the short and long forms (<?php ?> and <? ?>)
 Yes. I sent you the file
 you denied it so that is your fault
 That's set to do that automatically
 Because it's text, I assume pastesite would do
 http://i29.tinypic.com/35a9hzm.gif
 aahahahaha 8D
 O_o
 its a 3 frame gif i made in GIMP :D
 That answer your question Jacob? :p
 bit fast though tbh
 Thought you ignored me Cr`eme
 Uea
 Also this is data output to a browser, so not much real reason for blocking PHP tags ;)
 (Although I will)
 Lol sorry it's rather complicated
 On my other Mirc Yes I did
 I am running kubuntu in my virtual box
 What do you do Jacob
 ?
 But I am on Xchat
 Well make sure to get me blocked on all your clients
 lets see, what else...
 ?
 Oh wait they have xchat for windows too huh/
 Cr`eme: so pastesite?
 Or have you already there's something up there
 Alex I have already pasted it. Since you can view the files look at it.
 object, embed krisives too
 Ok, so you're saying you wrote that then: http://pastesite.com/9081 ?
 TheOracle: thanks, would have forgot those probably!
 :)
 np
 Started doing a blacklist... turned it into a whitelist LOL
 oh, and meta
 You don't want random refreshes
 I assume :P
 Cr`eme
 WHAT!?
 <Alex>Ok, so you're saying you wrote that then: http://pastesite.com/9081 ?
 that is the code
 Right, and it didn't come off, say
 Some forum somewhere
 Did you write it ?
 Cr`eme ... wow you're brilliant
 Just as an example
 Is that C++ ?
 lmao
 lmao
 @ krisives
 Yes Dave
 :P
 Wow that code is fail.
 Well dotn blame me
 So it didn't come off some forum or something like that, Cr`eme, you wrote it?
 :/
 Since you're saying it's yours
 You said you coded it though!
 Who else is there to blame if you coded that?
 Me. :P
 Not you krisives
 D:
 Yeah I figured it looked like he did it
 heh
 Hey that took me 5 months to write. And I have some fails that I havent compiled yet.
 I like the multitude of if statements
 lmao
 O_o
 I mean even a nested switch table would have been more logical than that
 Heh, fail @ SP
 Who's that?
 haha
 SP?
 Lol SP
 D:
 For a 3x3 grid you covered all 9 uses cases separately
 heh
 Wow .. all that in 5 months eh, Cr`eme ??
 With no code re-use
 You're quick ;)
 5months lol
 xD
 http://www.gotgames.com.au/forums/programming-109/tic-tac-toe-c-31916/ cough
 Dave, what do you expect from a DUMB DUMB
 Cr`eme, wtf would you do if you wanted to make a 25x25 tic-tac-toe?
 LOL
 damn
 IDK
 :O that looks like your code Cr`eme
 Cr`eme you fucking tit
 I guess start coding 625 if statements
 Such a liar D:
 someone stole your code creme
 thats fucked up
 :P
 haha
 xD
 It's sad that I've seen worse
 Krisives you know c++ ?
 I saw some javascript that turned a simple string scan for O(n) into O(n^4)
 krisives 627 statements
 Ben,  how is Tiny gRAB?
 Wait, no
 52
 Tiny Grab is comming along ok thanks
 Ben: Yeah, I've used C since I was 16
 rof
 l
 Ooh nice
 Big mistake eh Rob?
 Robert: Why 627, I'm a bit dense today
 wb Alex
 there would only be 52 if statements
 25 up/down 25 left/right 2 diagonal
 Well he does have 9 for a 3x3
 then he's a moron
 But that's because 3 is perfect
 and that's a horrible way to code it
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_Number
 There are 8 winning combinations on a 3x3
 Plus the stalemate
 Well, there are more stalemates, some are inevitable
 I just made my own browser in VisualBasic :p
 :/
 But finding all of those would be more effort
 I doubt that
 i'm sure you did creme
 lol
 :P lol
 :/
 how long did it take to copy paste and compile
 I think we all sigh everytime you press enter man
 You're laughing at yourself, you realize?
 SP TheOracle it's easy to make one, you just drag a control onto a form.
 like half an hour for you?
 Putting IE in a box is not making your own browser
 lol
 heh
 That's like putting tin foil on your TV and calling it a time machine
 No it is a simple code used in visual basic.
 ...
 see http://typol.co.uk/Grabs/UsY.png
 "a simple code" <-- wtf is that!?
 Oh god he think it's like a cheat code
 lmao

 Well, I don't as I don't receive nice emails like that :'(
 It wasn't an email

 It was a letter.

 hey can anybody help me out with this problemhttp://www.mibbit.com/pb/r1MRzA 
 your website is http://s72956.gridserver.com/dev/ ?
 lol brandon, my moms fav song XD from pitbull :P
 Dolleh that is a tune!!
 uh yes ben.. 
 domain name is up but that is the dev portal
 yup
 how was the dishes frank?

 hmm sorry don't think I can help not really understanding the problem.
  The menu on the website or the sidebar
 moves 
 when you move the browser window
 but if i set
 position:relative or static 
 and I click one of the javascript links the menu moves down
 hmm sorry don't know, maybe someone else can help
 whaaaat?
 not css, im no good
 uhoh its greg O.O
 uh oh!
 hello

 byebye all.. pub time :)

 so...
 Cya
 I'm beat out of my mind
 Hey Frank
 Hi
 Frank, could you help me with .htaccess
 Royal mail has a page :o
 bbs
 You mean we have to have you back Brandon?
 uh?
 anyone know if its ok to use <imgsrc="..."  alt="<h1>Site name</h1> /> for a logo
 img src*
 can there be header tags in the alt attribute?
 I wouldn't
 I'd just have <h1><a href="/" title="Back to Home">Site Name</a></h1>
 Or something like that
 Get the image in via CSS
 cause, idk where else to use the <h1> tag at
 im using a logo, with the site name inside it
 Hey CSS_Guru 
 Hey -.-
 lol
 why -.-?
 tehy called him he-man
 last time you called me bitch....
 :o Oh I was probably drunk 
 :P I am a lot. 
 Especially in the summer.
 Alex, maybe I should just do without <h> tags....
 CSS_Guru: yep, logo with the site name inside it is the exact time I would use what I described
 `/clear
 Use background to get the logo in on a blocked <a> for the clickable area
 And text-indent the text contents off the screen
 Easy stuff for someone with your nick...
 im using the image as a link  Alex
 wut
 cant help it, but all you guys are yellow, blue green and greg is the only purple one XD
 makes me lol
 ew
 loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
 And I suggested an alternative which fits in the <h1> making the site title a more semantic tag, Tommy
 I figured that was what you were after
 I created a logo-type, so theres no need for a title, but Im using a few other <h> tags, and skipped a few, so I was wondering if I could just throw in an <h1> tag using the alt attribute in my logo-type image. 
 I'm probably confusing you though lol
 Well, text that's only in an image is never good for SEO among other things
 It's not like they do character recognisation on images, so any keywords in the site title have lost some exposure from that choice
 Dunno why you asked if you don't want to change it ;)
 and an alt="" attribute won't fix that issue?
 Not in the same way, because things in <h1> get more focus
 what if I add an <h1> tag somewhere arounf the logo and made the color: transparent?
 You could I guess, but why not make them one thing like I said for the semantic value?
 Plus less markup
 lol
 It works, but it's hardly elegant
 it's just... I made the logo/logo-type soo perfect, I can't just use text instead
 There's no change in appearance in what I'm suggesting
 maybe, im not understanding something than...
 ewww they re-colored iaza D:
 FAIL
 I suggested making a blocked <a> inside a <h1> replace the <img>
 And the text content of the <a> would be pushed off the viewable area with text-indent or something similar
 I FAIL in life
 :P
 hmmm...
 what you mean "pushed off the viewable area"?
 text-indent: -400000px; something like that :p
 lol
 thats semantic?
 The markup is semantic, because you're adding more content
 ill use it if it is
 ok thanks
 using it Alex, thank you!
 The style is a little hackish to accommodate it, but what you're allowing is more separation of style and content.
 Which is always good :)
 Alex you little hacker
 Bye bye zymic
 :S
 Maybe the @ was meant to be a Â©? :-P
 That's a good term, Sonic, hacking if you take the non-media definition is normal :p
 Just means making it work by some questionably coding ;)
 questionable*
 Cracker is the bad one.
 so far I have the <h1><h2><h3> and <h6> tags...

 ?????//
 I just woke it up. Lol
 wat
 I won't be leaving this one also...
 .... :S
 My other PC
 was already on
 I woke it up
 You've already said that.. ? lol.
 Jack didnÂ´t seem to get it
 Only you had to say is "Other PC" then it wouldn't be hard to grasp from there :P
 Ben ^
 Best song.
 I read it as "I just woke up"
 Ah
 Ok
 Same :p
 Yeh love that song Brandon
 :)
 Why are you pleased about that :p
 I'm not :p
 AGAIN brandon? XD
 Dolleh: Yes.. different colour :p
 haha XD
 I have a few t-shirts that were £25
 And you can tell the fabric is better
 I need some new Air Max trainers
 But I don't think I'd spend any more than that
 Haha
 Though, admittedly I have for a few actual shirts.
 Â£45 for a t-shirt/polo is expensive. But.. It looks nice
 Alex you shop in JD ?
 Well, maybe if I was looking for trainers, sports shops are alright for that sort of thing
 You can get t-shirts in JD for Â£25? :p
 Because they stock some of the walking boots
 And tougher fare
 Yes Brandon :D
 Yea, Â£19.99 is what I saw just now :p
 As well as the nike crap ;)
 nike crap :O
 GTFO
 McKenzie FTW
 I want something comfortable that lasts, not something with a popular logo on it ;)
 chav
 I'm saying I avoid nike, what are you thinking?
 I thought calling it crap was fairly clear :p
 I don't know just felt like calling you a chav :(
 Suuure
 I would not buy any form of shirt from a sports shop though
 I don't like being in them at the best of times :p
 hah
 They're always crammed full, completely cramped, full of crap usually.
 Full of crap? I hope you're referring to people :p
 No, the stock ;)
 You do get some good stuff in there :p
 It's 2% worthwhile, 98% cheap rubbish
 Pfffy
 And that's generous :p
 Haha
 pffft*
 :O pfft your a snob ;-)
 All sport shops are the same
 No really?
 Silly expensive shit
 good shit*
 I have never seen anything I liked in a sports shop
 Then you are a snob like Alex
 I wouldn't use the term snob
 I didn't say there's no reason I'd go in there, there are some things they have alright stock of.  It's just very rare
 Safe to say never.
 They do have some alright footwear if you avoid as I said the nike crap which dominates them.  They have some of the stuff you usually only see in volume in the camping shops
 Decent comfortable stuff for walking in.
 I don't understand why the world has to have labels for what they wear, it's perfetic.
 hmmm how about river island ?
 I don't see why people want the labels, it's obvious why the companies stick big labels on
 Makes people walking advertisements
 But being proud of having certain brand clothes... nah
 Haha
 River Island <3
 Personally, if the name of the shop/designer is prominent, I won't buy whatever the piece of clothing was
 I don't like it.
 Republic has to be my favourite shop atm
 Night all
 Nooooooooooooo don't leave us Jacob! You're the only sane one among us.

 Use CSS & Divs
 And I dont know css
 Tables = EWWWWWW

 Tables = are bad ;-)
 I use tables for coding
 ^
 :S

 :P
 Cr`eme - LEARN CSS!

 CSS is easy
 Cr`eme die.

 :P
 :P
 Cr`eme, learn css, then come bac
 *back

 Although, it's pretty easy when I started coding it was easy got the hang of it :)
 Could you guys please tell me what to do. I will learn css when I am done with that page
 LOL.
 No
 NO!
 loooool
 Learn CSS!
 :PPP
 no guys
 You just need to seperate the logo and the 'hi' text in two seperate <tr> s
 Fag
 we should all start using tables
 If you insist on keeping the tables that is :p
 they are superior
 :p
 Tables are the bomb :P
 thanks Dave 
 Tables are the fail.
 ^
 CSS isn't hard to pick up Cr`eme 
 and you learn most by trying and failing
 Then learning your mistakes
 *from
 Well when I am done and I have time with coding then I will learn CSS. I even ordered a book on it. 
 Cr`eme - http://lmgtfy.com/?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3schools.com%2Fcss%2F

 That is the proper way to code Cr`eme
 Ben you are the BEST!!!!!!!!!!

 Its true Cr`eme 
 except I would normally put css in a seperate file, just put it in the same for ease
 Yeah I am going to do that
 Ben,  could you give me the code that actvates the css?

 :\
 Put it in a seperate file called style.css, then put this code in the <head> tag <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
 Tahnk you agsain
 Welcome back Brandon

 Hey ben
 But when I do margin-top: to #header
 it does the same thing
 as #wrapper { margin-top
 Of course it does
 Frank and Ben could you both please join #quixdraw ? 
 NO!

 Stop asking us to join
 What did you expect it to do.. I'm not sure what you're trying to do

 erm
 you see the white borders around it right?
 I could care less Cr`eme 
 :P Ok
 the problem is, i'd like the same thing on the top of the header/gray background
 Yes
 I dont care either
 however, if i use margin-top...
 it doesn't actually move the header down
 it moves the whole wrapper down
 k sec lemme draw this out
 Right I'm getting you know... you want a white border at the top?
 *now
 yeah
 but, without border-top :P
 Frank how is your client thingie coming up? Is it in beta?
 Im still working on it
 Don't think you can then
 yeah Dave i'm so confused right now lol
 orly
 :\
 Unless you want a white bit at the bottom too?
 no :(
 hmm
 i'll just use a new div
 lol
 yeh i was about to say
 Ben in visualstudioes how did you get the dropdown menu?
 I'd just use another div
 lol
 Less complicated then
 In the control list Cr`eme
 its a "ComboBox"
 Oh ok
 tatootian: You need help or is Dave helping you, I haen't been reading convo.
 nah it's fine
 I couldn't think of a way to do it Ben
 Dunno if you can ?
 too late lol
 already used a new div :(
 What does he want to do ?
 oh ok :p
 Uh, Ben...
 So my problem is
 I have a header div right?
 http://www.tatootian.log1x.com/vik/ the grey box ?
 ye
 if i move it down with margin-top
 it moves the whole wrapper/container down
 Ben I thiink that you might have thought about the wrong thing.
 I am talking about waht you have one the top of the WinUp
 so my only solution is to use a new div style
 Like Files and Tools
 Hmm ok lemme look 1 sec
 Ok
 Cr`eme thats a menustrip
 oh k
 You smartie Ben 
 hmm odd tatootian, mind If I re-code it and see if it works ?
 erm already used a new div style
 so it's all fixed :P
 Oh ok
 well If you want me to try find a new way without a new div then jsut ask :D
 :P
 Could always fix the position of the container.
 lol

 I do like % too
 hahahaha
 O_o
 i just had the pot wash give me advice on making the test text bigger..
 when hes telling me to do basic stuff i already did.
 Tis an embedded test. So it wont zoom
 the text was pathetic. David lloyd really should put attention into usability of their stuff
 heh
 bored now
 you what? :p
 trice, go back to work  then :P
 haha this test was stupid
 ed there was light blue text on a white background and the text was tiiiiny. Even hard for me to read. Made me dizzy
 Friday night I went to bed at 2AM and still woke up at 5:30 then again yesterday but later. How strange :o
 urgh phone

 Alex, how much would you spend on a wallet? 8-)
 Finished changing the trigger :O
 Trigger for?
 pyDelphi
 TheOracle
 Enough to get a decent leather one
 Â£70?
 Â£80*
 I haven't looked recently, sounds a bit expensive
 Hugo boss, very nice :p
 Â£20 from Marks and sparks?
 http://www.hugoboss-store.co.uk/Gibuti/50152405,en_GB,pd.html?color=001&size=0000
 heh
 I think Ed is closer to the mark here :p
 'That wallet is BOSS!'
 HUGO BOSS
 BUY IT
 rofl
 I have :p
 :D
 WOOT!
 :D
 I'm so silly though :/
 D:
 I think there are cheaper and nicer ones though :p
 I might pay up to £50, if it was really nice.  But I think the one I've got wasn't more than £30
 Â£80 on a wallet...
 ed... HUGO BOSS
 alex smells
 Does it do anything special? ;)
 Its a BOSS wallet Bread! It's BOSS!
 Ed, yes.
 BAR somewhere to store money
 http://www.marksandspencer.com/gp/product/B001P79DI2/sr=1-1/qid=1248625924/ref=sr_1_1/275-8414934-5680845?ie=UTF8&node=42966030&m=A2BO0OYVBKIQJM&keywords=men%20wallets&mnSBrand=core&size=9&rh=&page= < Nice wallet :o
 It comes in a gift box, and has a matching key ring, Ed!
 Wow ;)
 Heh :p
 NO brandon, stick to the hugo boss D<
 lol
 And it has "hugo boss" in various places.. :p
 ^win
 HUGO BOSS
 Found mine :p

 In black
 Not bad
 The above looks better imo :p
 It's in black and it's leather
 Not the hugo boss one
 Much of a muchness :p
 Haha
 From the outside I mean
 The inside of the two are fairly different
 I bet
 Well, you can see, they both have pictures :p
 One of them is purely notes/cards the other notes/cards/coins/id
 Yea
 Yours is notes/cards/coins/id ? :p
 Yeah
 Plus one of the things is quite good for my railcard (since I don't have one of the plastic ones, I bought it in a station :p)
 It wouldn't fit in a credit-card sized slot
 :p
 Used to have one of those credit-card swiss army knives in there, but decided I needed to prioritise
 So it's a credit card bottle opener now ;)
 heh
 All I need to store in a wallet is; acer id, acer access card, bank card, ni card, business cards and moneys. that's it. :)
 Bottle opener :p
 Prepared then.
 http://www.myset.co.uk/images/products/227/large_wallet-bottle-opener-pack2.jpg one of those ;)
 I prefer normal bottle openers
 But if there isn't one around

 Making games is boring.

 LOL ITS STREET FIGHTER BRANDON :O
 Shocking.

 LOL
 You obviously never played games from when I was growing up
 its was like Teken
 You didn't build in the fireball then :p
 I has the sprties alex :D
 I do have quick time tho
 Just takes more animation and brain power to do it
 oh well bleh
 *cough* tekken tim?
 yeh
 how dare you make that typo :O
 Tim, I played it on the Nintendo
 :d
 Not too much, it's quite an easy projectile :p
 Since it ignores gravity, goes in a straight line, just needs collision detection
 One of theses; http://www.bruceongames.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/nintendo-entertainment-system.jpg
 Not that it's much more complicated to make it a "true" projectile on a 2D map
 haha fucking old school Brandon ;)
 Yep
 I have some star was sprites
 Ryu Vs. AT-AT :P
 ew
 fucks sake
 Finally, damn asynchat.py
 Dunno why the hell they wouldn't add such an important clause there, since every time there's no data to remove it disconnects :/
 %test
 pyDelphi is working.
 I just bought forcequ.it

 Hmm
 %seen DarkKrai
 Sorry, I haven't seen darkkrai around.
 it onyl works voice+
 :D
 :O
 Well...
 !seen DarkKrai
 DarkKrai was last seen here 3 days, 3 hours, 33 minutes ago.
 There.
 Now go get me a hamburger.
 Fatty.
 You go get ti you'll need the excersize
 I'm actually Anorexic
 So I need the fat
 lolwut
 %wik Anorexia
 "Anorexia (symptom), the symptom of poor appetite whatever the cause" - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anorexia
 ^ Anorexic
 Yeah, if you actually look at that
 It's an eating disorder focused around fear of gaining weight
 So you wouldn't ask for a burger if you were
 Hahaha
 Well, I don't know the term then :/
 All I know is I'm dangerously skinny
 There was some T.V. show about Anoerxia, some 17 year old girl weighed 6 stone and said she was overwight
 Thin?  Underweight? :p
 My family calls me "Sticks" ;_;
 Low BMI?
 Take your pick :p
 Yes.
 BMi is a load of bullshit
 Wii Fit called me underweight
 D:
 According to her BMI, my nan is overweight
 shes tiny though
 Well don't take it literally then, that's your problem
 It's an indication, and shouldn't be taken as absolute
 I can wrap my thumb and pinky around my wrist D:
 I almsot can
 and i have big wrists
 :O my skin is peeling on my arms WTF
 Wrist is not really where it matters so much :p
 Stomach tbh?
 I didn't even get sunburn there
 Well, if you're talking about muscle mass, then further up the arm
 Or around the legs, where the muscle actually is :p
 Alex: If I flash you, you can see my ribs protruding from my chest
 So join a gym ;)
 Could
 cba
 bbl, gonna eat lunch
 That's also a good plan
 so hungry my head hurts D:
 food = share TO :O
 Sorry Dolleh

 Brandon, wtf kind of dreamworld are you living? :p
 :P
 fash or vb for my assignment
 flash
 vb as in visual basics ?
 Good day all
 anyone have knowledge of the iframes width capability, can it exceed 999 px?
 yes brandon
 Hey BlackTie 
 I'd say VB then.
 hello Ed
 Shouldn't be any restriction on it BlackTie 
 I've been working like the devil to get it past 1000 and just can't seem to get it, would you mind having a look see
 yeah brandon exactly. And vb is a bit better programming wise than flash
 :)
 What is it you got to make?
 Tricee: vb sucks
 ^
 C++ much better
 or C#
 Indeed, but as you're not using it then don't worry about it.
 flash sucks too.but i need to make a usable and simulated phone lol
 Meh :-P
 so if i do the design of the phone in photoshop, ill do the work in vb
 :)
 Tricee: that would be easier in flash
 much easier
 oh I think I found it
 i dont see it at easier :(
 then ?
 Whats a good ftp server application for linux
 Pie`: I think you can get a FileZila server from filezila.. :p
 easier in vb than flash for me.
 Flash is more a designers tool
 Yea, I ought to learn how to use that at some point. :-P
 yeah Trice but it has all the things you want to make the project
 Doubtful.
 btw what do you mean by usable ?
 Easily understood and controlled in less than 5 mins etc.
 Hey
 Hey
 ok then flash got everything you want
 How' it hanging, Cr`eme?
 Oh?
 Nm
 flash will make things much easier, you don't want to create an image for every menu in the phone etc.
 does O2 go by any other name 
 ?
 No
 Not that I know of :-P
 have a lot of work to do I see aye tricee :P
 lol
 Dolleh: what happened with the drawing ?

 Hah.

 To the toilet. 
 And it smelled
 I got it Ed, thanks - i simply overlooked  two "width sets" at the bottom of the html page. I appreciate the knowledge that it should have no restrictions (I'll have to be more observant from now on)
 Nice one, Trice.

 Meh, you still haven't kicked his arse have you?

 Theres no obvious link to it on the homepage :P

 There is when you create a new account
 imo, http://rune-shiver.com/
 and DOS is simple

 (It's hosted on zymic)
 its used to host a bunch of runescape private servers (Which are very illegal)
 Thanks
 I will look into it

 because the parents don't know what their kids get up to most of the time

 fair enough

 I live near horses. I am sure you can buy it on eBya
 I was going to say I know you have a camera

 But no one uses conditioner or shampoo anyways
 keep her outside in the sun for a weekend, she'll use it

 How do I stop my keyboard typing (Ã¤) instead of "a
 horse semen is expensive i think
 in a program or just all around
 sometimes in a language setting or sometimes through a font
 if it's a program usually thru the language settings
 fonting is pretty obvious
 hmm
 SP_, bull semen is too
 Sometime it happens, other time it doesn't

 TheOracle: do you have any experience with JQuery 
 ?
 No sorry
 come to me if you need python help :)
 :)
 haha, ok thanks :)
 TheOracle: 
 		import functions
 		functions.parseCmd(s, ex[3], ex[2])
 why does that not work?
 no errors are given
 :P
 it just doesn't do anything
 is that python? or php?
 python
 can't tell from context
 ah, let me see
 ah; TheOracle
 its because of my elif statement
 elif ex[2] == 'PRIVMSG':
 that isn't becomign true :(
 aha
 hurrdurr :3
 because PRIVMSG == ex[1]
 :p
 ;p
 heh it works :p
 hey dronix
 dronix: you have experience with JQuery ?
 su[
 ?
 nope
 oh, thanks anyway.
 TheOracle, would there be a better way to doing commands in Python?
 because right now everytime a PRIVMSG is recieved, it re-imports the functions script :p
 qwould it be possible to only reload the functions script when i say so ?
 so i can changes the commands on the fly
 I think so, PM me a pastesite or something?
 ugh, my script is spread accross 3 files atm :p
 script(s)
 then three pastesites dummy :p

 plug-in cycle is working Lightbox is not
 ah cool
 cool feature
 whys the logo off center
 Adam suggested it
 O_O
 I'm starting to move it back to center
 :S
 or maybe even to the left
 btw TheOracle, do you have IE ?
 ? :o hey dronix
 Parker's ballpoint refils are irritating, never know it's going to run out until you're write with it and it doesn't work :/
 I do rebel
 Ed, always carry a spare :P
 IE7/6 or somat
 TheOracle: can you please check the site in both 6 and 7
 Heh, hardly convenient Pie` :-p
 I only have one or the other rofl
 I know it'll look horrible in 6, but how much horrible 
 but ok
 or Ed, get a bic ?
 oh ok then whatever you have
 They're cheap as chips and you can see when they're low
 True, but it's no where as nice to write with 
 Picky picky picky..
 ;)
 we have bic here !
 because bic is awesome
 because of spelling disturbs me.
 rebel: The slideshow wontwork, but its because I have javascript disabled in IE (wtf?)
 bic is not awesome at all
 Bic's are for biting; not writing 
 TheOracle: k, how about the layout ?
 transparency works ? 
 looks fine
 looks like he might feel bad that no1 said bye :s
 ye
 I remember my social studies teacher always had a bic on his ear and he would chew on it like crazy. If a student asked to borrow a pen, he would give them his chewed up one.
 wow
 do you have montex ? montex is awesome
 rebel: yea its fine; thats in IE 7.0.5730.13
 ok thanks TheOracle
 fine in Google Chrome too
 I only care about IE
 if it works in ff then it works in Chrome/opera/safari in 99% of the time
 and if not fixing it would be much easier 
 Nope never heard of montex
 Not that it means we don't have them
 montex is indian I guess
 I was walking around Fenchurch (Insurance sector of London) a couple of weeks ago where my friend works and there's a penshop that was selling pens for Â£800+
 aha
 *.event
 woohoo
 How do you stop Helvetica from interfering with other fonts and making some text on websites looking funny?
 I wouldn't want to write with a pen costing that :/
 Well I'm out
 %part #ymic
 how much a bic cost in the UK ?
 %part #ymic
 %part #ymic
 DAMN

 is Jython a python script parser of java
 or is a java class parser for Python ?
 It took me a few seconds, but I looked it up, Pie`
 An implementation of python, so a parser of that, written in Java
 With the ability to integrate with Java
 Since I assume you can inline Python code into a Java application, or do pure Python if you don't like the standard interpreter

 Tim, thats..so...awesome
 http://dznr.org/yx67   <--

 When did Twitter update their home?

 Tim I'm thinking  about offering an iPhone VPN service, I opened http://hidemyass.com/vpn/
 As my dads GF is ex german forces
 Dolleh :D
 For users who are mainly on Wifi or what have you
 :D
 Not phone connection, would be slow
 yeah
 But I think the iPhone is very restrictive?
 as soon as brandon tips up Im off
 Dont think so
 If I tried to get a VPN app made
 They have the VPN library built in
 The default VPN settings won't do
 Ahh
 Yeah but we run OpenVPN :|
 Hmm
 Yeah I don't think basing it on another VPN technology would work, would have to use Apples :(
     the thing is
 Hmm
 think is is apple let you use OpenVPN
 people would then use openSSH
 Tim: do you own dznr.org ?
 Apple say the file system is locked down
 put I proved them wrong when I opened it all up from an app built from xcode in a sand box hehe
 No Pie
 my friend at microsoft BDU Mac department does
 :D
 because theres no register link on the homepage

 thank god for the java api..
 Last night I was trying to parse the message from an irc PRIVMSG command, without the use of the java api
 so i ended out with some poor code, just shortened it to: msg = in.substr(indexOf(":", 0), in.length());
 it should wor
 hm not quite
 :S
 meh, a little bit of tweaking fixed it
 Anyone on Vista have a few mins for some testing?
 Jack.. yep ?
 Ah
 Ok thanks well
 Type in Windows firewall advanced security
 tell me when the window is up
 kk
 Click outbound 
 Then new rule 
 New rule > Custom > This program path (selected Internet Explorer) > Protocol type any > Local IP address (then entered in the IP shown in ipconfig) > block
 connection > save.
 To find your local IP address go to command prompt ipconfig then its something like this:  IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.64
 kk done
 next?
 Open IE
 do websites load?
 google yes
 zymic yep
 It didnt work
 Could you edit the rule
 do it for any local ip
 Just double click it and remove the local ip rule
 ok
 still loads pages
 :|
 Must be something with your PC
 Works here
 :p
 Thanks though :(
 sorry
 can't see what it is.. I've double checked all settings you said
 Just do a program rule not custom
 select IE
 then try
 still works :/
 That's a bit worrying really
 Good day all
 Welcome, ZARDOZ, to #zymic!
 I hope my welcome message made you feel welcomed.
 Thx Sync`
 The forum is barely loading for me this morning
 Dave sorry
 Back
 wb Jack
 Yes it is worrying because thats not meant to happen :|
 Sure you have the firewal enabled?
 yes checked that first of all :p
 Ok ha
 tried it on chrome too but did nothing there either
 Yeah anyway
 The problem for me is
 It works on IE
 But not firefox
 I wanted to know if it is my firefox or something
 ahh let me just install firefox and I'll give that a go too
 No no
 IF the simple application rule doesnt work
 Then something is not working at all
 Your problem is the firewall isn't working fullstop 
 forum seems okay now, must've just been my connect
 hmm yes which means something somewhere isn't right :/ what's overriding it
 can anyone here access SHAKERS-BARBADOS.COM 
 Yes
 Loads
 rico: yep
 Congratulations, your Zymic Free Web Hosting account has been sucessfully created!
 i cant believe whats happening 
 rico, did you just change DNS on the domain ?
 grrr i cant acees it locally 
 yeah
 just leave it for a while
 some ISP takes more time to notice
 i cant access that neither hawthornmethodist.com
 try in command prompt;
 iirc: ipconfig /flushdns
 that clears your dns cache
 no luck
 it might be the isp
 probably
 some take more to process it than others
 hmm rico u sure?
 ok its getting to me though 
 yup
 ok
 no one in my island see the sites
 only on the vndv.com extension
 like shakers.vndv.com
 Christ
 This guy emailed me a hosting question
 He CC'd it to: http://pastesite.com/plain/9524/sdsdsd.txt
 haha
 "Does your hosting allow cronjobs"
 Talk about trying to shop around *_*
 i <3 cronjobs
 I wish windows had them :(
 Good morning everyone
 afternoon Sazzad
 :-D
 i will be back in 30 mins pie`
 i feel like killing myself 
 don't do that rico
 we will miss you :(
 :-O Don't do that
 going to work but this problem is getting me really irritated
 Heh, if you were serious you would of done it.
 >:-)
 Hody Ed
 Hey
 tututu ed, came online to push emo's over the edge huh?
 :o
 who told you?
 sazzad is innocent ed :D he didn't say nothing
 :-D
 ^innocent
 See that's my home girl defending me. *Tears*
 You guys should really use pm ;)... I'm not convinced.
 How is all today?
 uhoh, sazzad you think he might know it? D:
 should we hide?
 i am back pie`
 omg rico your aliveeee!
 i think so
 Why in my firefox prefs.js file in line irc.lists  does irc.zymic show 26 times and mibbit.com show 43 times ?
 you've saved a lot of settings?
 How have I done that?  This is the first time ever I have used IRC
 Fly747, does anyone else in your family ?
 No one else uses this PC. I use it for win32 program development and it is restricted to just me.
 This is a sample of many: irc%3A//irc.zymic.com/; http%3A//www.mibbit.com; http%3A//tinyurl.com/2rle7f; http%3A//pastesite.com;
 You sure you mean 'prefs.js'?
 @Ed yes, here is the start of the line...  user_pref("extensions.irc.urls.list", "irc%3A//irc.zymic.com/;
 The string of data for the setting user_pref("extensions.irc.urls.list" is 2649 chars long
 Do you have chatzilla?
 @Ed:  nope!
 @sync`: hi
 HELLO
 I don't really see the issue Fly747 
 It's firefox adding them, not us
 rofl
 Internet explorer > firefox
 Opera is my main browser.
 itnternet explorer is the best
 @Ed  OK, I shall edit the data and see what shows up as I go to various sites. If problems persists, see my doctor!
 If I recall correctly, mibbit is added as an irc:// handler in future / present versions of Firefox
 Afternoon all :)
 @Craig  wrong, it's morning here :-)
 Relatively speaking ofcourse.
 It's always 5 oclock somewhere. Where's mu beer
 not here
 its only 5 o'clock for 1 minite of the day here
 Dang, that'll keep ya sober
 here too Sonic :O
 xD
 welcome back Jack 
 @Ed  I searched PC and now I do see Chatzilla folders. Should i remove it?
 Up to you, I can't see any of this being detrimental, the only effect it could have is slowing firefox down, but nothing that significant.
 Thans Ed. will try removing it. I think maybe it makes FF slow to startup
 "the only effect it could have is slowing firefox down"
 Jack, why have i never seen you talk except to ask if hidemyass.com is up?
 Sonic: because maybe he's busy ? :P
 no one is too busy to connect to irc and never speak 99% of the time they're on it
 Ed, can you tell pie` he keeps "/notice Sonic wut?"
 Ed, can you tell Sonic he keeps /notice Pie` idiot
 STOP!

 I don't want to speak to you Sonic, thats the point.

 aha
 @ sonic, kick ass of useless pieces of shit.. as example...err.. things like YOU
 Could not find status 1 for andrewc2
 Andrew: yes I realize that, but maybe he got mixed up when he said @sroracle or something
 Sonic: Any more and you're getting a gline.
 Sonic FYI a gline is a complete ban from the server altogether
 Because I never wanted a google voice invite
 You won't be able to connect ever again
 I wanted a voice and wave invite
 ic
 I just want a wave invite ;)
 -Sonic- i know ill evade it
 He just noticed me that ed^
 GLINE!
 wow guys
 Heh, wonder how he plans on doing that
 think i need a shower o.0
 jaxm, go shower

 A hint, Sonic, we automatically block all known tor nodes, any known open proxies
 D< off the hair you ****
 No Brandon
 Godaddy is shitty slow. >.<
 haha im sorry Dolleh , i love you
 w/o www. too

 Democracy time, those who are being irritated by Sonic say "I"
 I
 I 
 AYE
 I
 those who object, say O
 or I
 You're a free man, Sonic !
 O
 if there was a line like this the text would never be visible right?   document.write('<div id="topmsg" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden">'+message+'</div>')
 display:none I'd say
 yeh
 okay thks
 to get it to view , jus remove the visibility right
 anyone wanna check this page and see if i missed anything?
 yeh Zardoz
 JaXm: I will
 thx
 document.getElementById('topmsg').style
 that's some sketchy shit
 hold on a sec.. saw a few things
 k
 http://evonyradio.com/new/
 converting all the pages to .php as well
 gotta change like everything :S
 the links shouldn't be blue imo
 actually yea i need a new link color for that
 little stuff like that is gonna be getting changed...
 something wrong here: http://localhostr.com/files/c2c34d/latestshows.png
 same thing with the listen live pic
 I suppose "Even" should have some left margin
 Event*
 yea thats gonna be getting entirely re-done
 JaXm, I would personally center your donate area
 ^
 thats what I was going to say
 alrighty
 hrm
 jus gotta figure out how lol
 Next time you're abusive, it's a gline.
 maybe text-align:center
 thats how I usually do it
 And one more thing: when you hover over the media player, make it glow or some other hover effect :)
 that'll be nice
 http://pastesite.com/9531
 thats the quick links code section
 how would i center the donate?
 try text-align:center
 I think that works with images too, can't remember
 lol
 try <center>
 and wen u want it to stop
 </center>
 thats deprecated, CSS ftw
 <center> isn't valid
 Andrew, JaXm, TheOracle, and anyone else... http://69.244.39.40/hh/final/ <-- feedback thus far? no footer yet, im aware.
 <--- noob
 noload Hastings
 where do i put that align center part?
 wait nvm
 huh?
 JaXm: style attribute for the img
 k
 Hastings: eww underlines :p
 ???
 <img style="text-align:center;" .... >
 I don't really like it Hastings
 Doesn't flow too well
 im fine with it except the underlines for the links
 and the red comes out of nowhere
 although having your contact box dark gray is...weird
 that didnt work :/
 <img style="text-align:center" alt="" border="0" src="https://www.paypal.com/en_US/i/scr/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1">
 ok
 remove the style form the image
 then move it to the form
 from the image*
 nope
 Andrew, TheOriacle - look at it from the point of view of uniqueness, though. It's a simple page that gets the job done... It's got blue tones in the top, red in the bottom
 waitr
 ahh it works now
 :)
 http://evonyradio.com/new/
 =D
 :D
 alrighty time to start doing the rest of the pages
 hi
 thanx for unban
 google chrome update yay

 public static final Properties prop = new Properties();
 wow

 whuts with my name? D:
 I jus heard twitter got hacked bad this morn jus recently got back up
 DDoS
 Been down for a couple of hours for me, so I guess so.
 I've tried everything I know to get this javascript to work   http://www.zymic.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=1276  anybody got any ideas?
 There's rumours facebook was hit too
 nothing on facebook in the news jus twitter and they're back supposedly
 Facebook has been fine for me
 I just was trying to get the feel for the JS a little better that's why I tried that 1276
 probably bad from the get go
 Hello people
 hey Rob
 using your old nick?
 Hopefully not for long
 But yes for now
 How come?
 Long story
 I've got all day. :p
 Well, I think Brandon has Robert on ignore
 and lotsa space here
 Ah. And you need to contact him about sBot/tBot correct?
 Yep
 ic
 According to msn, he's asleep! @swordz
 I've been told the answer to my Q now.
 I'm just annoyed he didn't tell me
 arghhh
 Complicated ness!
 What's gone wrong?
 http://bigbadtest.rhyan.uni.cc/
 that's gone wrong
 I have no idea why i'm getting forbidden
 That's problematic
 I have no htaccess in my home directory
 Unless there is one that's being read for all sites that i'm not seeing
 I would see the damn .* files in ssh right rob?
 Should do if you're using ls -alh
 I think -a is all?
 hrm, no index file, but it should list the directory contents, I need to figure out why it's not
 it is
 yea nothing in the public_html folder where the files are getting served from
 the sym links work correctly
 Robert where's sbot?
 I guess not listing directory contents is nice
 how often do you guys wank?
 400 times an hour
 Ahh I can only manage 399 :(
 Gotta catch up dave
 Brandon made sBot go away, forever!
 No it's your fault Sync` 
 Both of those comments were uneccessary
 The first more than the second
 I guess it was more of a #nsfw question 
 Probably
 http://bigbadtest.rhyan.uni.cc/
 Works now
 I guess I can't have directory listings unless I change httpd.conf
 I'm too lazy atm
 I thought it would have created a new temp index.html, probably something else I have to configure
 wot was the big bad test
 Ionno just chose a subdomain I'd never use

 `length soundsmix_user
 Length: 14
 The function alert() in this case should throw up 26. So make a mental note that to calculate the length of a string str in JavaScript, it is str.length and not str.length().
 this page lies
 Ha
 str.length; gives me the declaration of a function
 Pie`: Is angry
 however str.length() gives me the length of the string :@
 [13:23:11] <Pie`> !length test
 [13:23:13] <Jotta> function length() {/*
 thats the output of str.length
 but str.length() gives me 4 D:
 what's the problem here?
 oh now that is weird
 if i do, javascript:var x = "test"; alert(x.length);
 in a browser
 in alert's me with 4

 wow, that's a set back - she bruising hard
 yea
 its all black and blue... swollen and hurts like a sob
 ohhhh, not a good sign - nothing protruding is there
 nah
 but every time i put pressure on it... like a sharp stabbing pain :S
 probably a hairline
 they seem to hurt more than an actual severe
 yea
 i had stress fractures that havent ever healed in my shins and lower ankles... so they mighthave spread and popper
 idk
 that bites, it is an area you can't really immobilze cuz of the fluxation of the digits back to the ankle from the tips of the toes
 w/o the cast
 my sympathies JaXm
 yea it sucks :(
 you gonna be able to get it chk'd out through services?
 nah
 well maybe if they give me some medical benefits too
 If you starting getting feverish, don't hesitate to get it chk'd
 better a bill u can't pay than complicate that type of injury
 being a vet do like I did and show up at the veterns hospital, they'll write it off
 yea
 they didn't want to but they did fix me up

 what a waste of time
 i was gonna help a friend on a freelance work
 now we figure they're using windows servers
 Wow.
 Sign me up
 I use them at work
 within a few minutes, active directory crashed
 then the database
 :D
 yay windows \o/
 now it's an allnighter for them. they'll be installing solaris.
 and oracle.
 pain in the ass.
 in my ex-company, we had some sort of deranged network topology
 half of the servers were running on solaris.
 deranged lol
 the other half were running on linux inside vmware on top of windows 98s.
 now you see why i call it deranged?
 :D
 and only if you could see the stwitches and hubs interconnecting...
 wow
 why in gods name would they do that
 they're just afraid to format anything with the fear of losing data.
 lol.
 i think they're still using the same servers... although we'd changed the topology a bit.
 those 98s are still up there..
 linux is vmware is the stupidest server configuration ever
 in*
 anything in vmware is..
 thats what a vps is...?
 its 1 os, with lots of virtual machines inside it
 but there's a point in vps.
 especially if the vms share the kernel.
 in this particular example, however, each of those servers are running one instance of vm.
 which eliminates the point of using a vm.
 oh thats stupid
 besides, running those vms on top of win98 ??
 rofl
 it's beyond stupid.
 anyways
 does anyone know the ctcp for an ACTION command ?
 ctcp("PRIVMSG " + dest + " \001ACTION " + act + "\001");
 doesn't seem to work :/
 that gave me [15:41:17] [Jotta:#rsbot ACTION]
 i think it might be just ACT
 thing is though, ic opied that exactly form my other irc bot, which works perfectly
 exacept the other bot was written in php
 i have no recollection of irc knowledge.
 what is the \001 doing
 Octal for 0x01
 Java
 ew
 Pie`: Just use raw log in xchat or wireshark

 Wow I've never been welcomed like that on IRC lol
 what a cheerful bunch of people we have..
 dont we.
 Haha

 will someone test this site for me? http://sharpielovers.com/NDtemp/
 THIS IS HOT
 as far as I can tell it works in ff 3.5 ie 8
 and opera
 o i see an error in opera
 ONe sec kdigennaro 
 kk thanks :D
 nice site
 thanks
 its getting ther lol
 but it seems like the login box isn't working
 whats wrong with it?
 nothing seems to work actually. but i suppose they're just not complete yet.
 it's just a layout
 correct  :D
 not a backend
 :p
 :D
 nothing happens when i put username and password and hit GO!
 haha
 oh
 hehe
 It's just the html lol
 ok :)
 i need to code that music player... cant decide how though
 kdigennaro: Don't use flash or I will take my stroke back
 i guess you're all professional web designers/makers here
 haha that's the last thing I want to use jacob :D
 We prefer to use the term "l33t"
 <3 kdigennaro 
 not really Kiss, most of us are like 16-20 going through school lol
 Jacob wat should i use?
 xml?
 oh, hehe
 can i right the entire player in xml?
 never even thought of that
 Actually, go have a look at this simple flash one
 http://flashden.net/item/simple-and-elegant-xml-music-player-1/42902
 ew flash :(
 I know, but seems it is separate so it is easy to isolate
 Kissmystairwell: What happened to your friend?
 What language would I use in place of the flash?
 Actually.
 New plan
 Die flash
 AJAX to the rescue
 i was looking for an ajax one
 never could find tbh
 didnt no wher to look lol
 http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&q=ajax+music+player&btnG=Google+Search&meta=&aq=f&oq=
 thats where ive been looking :P
 Jacob: i don't know, why is that?
 If I could have babies to google, I would.
 lolo
 I'd imagine that'd be quite difficult
 is this script worth 8 bucks? http://flashden.net/item/sliding-image-gallery-with-scrollbar/41670 would save me a lot of coding
 Jacob: oh, he said he's a bit busy
 cheaper than having someone write it for you kdigennaro 
 ugh still can't find something to code my music player lol
 That's true ed, plus its only 8 bucks thats not much at all considering it will save me hours and hours
 kdigennaro: http://us.ajax13.com/en/ajaxtunes/index.jsp
 Wrong chan
 lol i got it
 do they give the source?
 yea
 do i just have to sign up?
 Hmm
 Sign up :P
 kk lol
 wow
 registration page has a 404 lol
 sick
 lol so much for that one :P
 and that actually looks pretty nice lol
 Night all

 what does the "x.xxxx seconds ; -- ; x queries ; GZIP Enabled" at the bottom of the forumpages mean?
 thats stats
 seconds = serve time (time to render the page and send it to you)
 queries is how many db queries it took to render the page
 and GZIP enabled means that GZIP compression is enabled for all outgoing content :)

 I got a laptop today. Covered with "Accidental damage" x'D
 The owner drove over his laptop with a 4x4 O_o
 ed D< the kid didn't deserve THAT!
 don't do it edddd
 Only thing I needed to change was the heatsink/fan > wlan card > odd :p
 And LCD panel ofcourse
 Haha, does "Accidental damage" cover that?
 Yep
 if you're versed in computer hardware, perhaps you can tell my what's wrong with my laptop
 I press the power-on button, the green light turns on for about five seconds, then it shuts down
 no fans spin, doesn't try to do anything
 What laptop?
 dell inspiron
 Is it clean? The fan/heatsink ?
 i cleaned all the dust out etc
 i think i may need new heatgel on the heatsinks
 would that cause the laptop to not boot at all?
 Does it have any thermal paste on the heatsink? O_O
 a tiny bit
 it needs more
 I think the real problem is that its a dell :D
 yeah
 i've had troubles with it from the day I got it
 Same with mine lol
 came delivered with a bad screen
 I wish I would have bought any other laptop.. lol
 i got it for christmas so it wasn't my choosing
 :p
 I choose mine... :(
 ouch
 yup
 and the funny thing was that I told my self going into the search that I wasn't getting a dell
 Dell rhymes with hell... a coincidence?
 Should have chosen a mac ;-)
 Haha not at all ed :D
 I think not
 Brandon macs cost so much :( but i want one so bad lol
 Bless.
 will probably get one next year for school
 You still go school? O-o
 O_o*
 ya :P
 about to graduate high school lol
 Loser. :-P
 :P
 This this lame american system :P
 It's*
 i'll get a new laptop in a year when i go to college
 Any one go to / have heard of Mount Saint Joe?
 I think everyone in the UK now has to stay in school till they are 18. Sad.
 Wow that is sad
 i'll be 18 when i graduate HS anyway
 :p
 It's stupid tbh.
 Glad I got out now :-p
 I'm taking everything online now :P
 "Researchers from The University of Tokyo have demoed a touchable hologram at Siggraph 2009.

"
 I like how much thoguht they put into the name
 touchable holography.
 lmao
 What's your name? O_o
 Trying to find a good graphic design/ web development school to go to in the US... perferably close to home :P
 go to ITT TECH LOL
 lol
 whats the leading major for web development?
 The Zymic.com registration is still ongoing, correct?
 my brother is contemplating
 Like if I want to create websites for a living what kind of degree should I go for?
 Yes zpcs|layout 
 Couldn't go wrong with computer science
 kdigennaro You probably have different degree course over in the US
 'course you find stuff somewhat more interesting than just making websites in that course ;)
 if you're serious about design an art minor wouldn't hurt
 Alex what does computer science cover?
 Oh right, sorry, design.  Web development I tend to think more the backend :p
 the science of computers, whatelse
 :D
 I want to go through something that teaches the front end, back end, and design aspect
 Computer science would be what you were going for if you wanted to do the backend, the programming, if you wanted to work on websites like a google engineer
 Rather than as a designer
 I guess I could get a minor in Computer science and a major in design? or something like that?
 That seems reasonable
 is there an actual 'design' major?
 Alex: that sounds good for me :)
 What would make more sense, getting the major in computer science or design?
 If I can get really good at python I could work for the backend for the CIA's website
 Computer science is about the theory and practice of computer systems from the electronics to the architecture to the abstracted software level
 SP I'm not sure but I'm sure ther's something along those lines
 Until you specialise there's roughly equal focus on electronic physics, theory of programming, computing mathematics, computer architectures and algorithms and data structures
 <Stan>Stan the either. We need a stork on my hard drive, then throw Scott off a stork
 heh
 The last you can lump in with theory of programming but it's important enough to deserve its own section ;)
 :D
 TheOracle: yes, I would assume they only take on people with (depending on how many people they need) at least a highish honours degree in computer science or a related focused degree
 :)
 I could aim for that
 Or people with experience, or if they've got most spots filled they might require you to already be a chartered software engineer
 Don't know exactly, but the decent honours in a compsci related degree would be an ideal start
 Maths would also work if you want to go that way, but it means you need to find a company willing to train the programming aspect later
 But if you've got a good maths degree, you'll pick up the computer science theory fairly quickly.  Though I doubt you'd have quite the same grounding unless you took time out to cover it
 any one know hot to install modules in joomla????
 don't use joomla :/
 its reaaaaalllllyyyyy insecure
 no
 'tis
 its modules are awesome
 theres a new vulnerability posted on milw0rm every other day
 what you use?
 php?
 wut
 do u use CMS?
 no
 then?
 :confused:
 do u hav a website?
 I have had websites in the past
 okay
 Hhaattzzz if you want to use Joomla modules on zymic you must manually extract and upload them via FTP
 Joomla should have further instructions on their website (www.joomla.org)
 i hav uploaded them but installing from folder gives error JFolder:cannot create directory
 and php ftp is not supported on zymic
 Exactly
 So open your FTP client and upload them
 i hav
 but they are not installed

 any buddy have some c&c on this so far? particularlly the logo? www.sharpielovers.com/Port/layout1port.png
 Frank i like where it is going, but the tab at the top seems to dark aswell as the frames around the images
 yep,  think so.
 kk :D thanks for the c&c
 OK, maybe lighten the tab a bit? I'll also try to lighten the borders around the images a bit
 indeed, you could lighten that tab. i agree.
 not sure about the borders, well need to see it in the full page, but i guess the tab should be a bit lighter.
 Evening!
 :D
 How about something like this? - http://grabs.uni.cc/qzddqabOLOPn67gxFYg9.png
 its hard to see it without the rest of the page to be honest frank
 i suspect you could go even lighter
 it just feels like there is to much of that shade of blue on the page, the bg that is, and if you ligten the tab and chagne the frames that feeling should go away
 http://grabs.uni.cc/Y9g5yJKwfdky1fQ7I8SV.png
 Thats with the lightened tab
 i think you can do even lighter
 why is it that i canno open these d
 let me see if i can find the shade
 grabs.uni.cc addresses... am i the only one to have problem with them?
 No me too
 I cant view any pic
 closer to this frank, #008EFA
 cant sware that matches exaclty but something bright like that color
 I had it set to overlay before
 Weird.. can you access http://uni.cc
 ^ Gaddar?
 yes
 Where are you hosting it, Frank?
 It's not uni.cc then
 but not grabs.
 yeah, grabs has a problem.
 On my other hosting
 probabÅy the domain is new, and the dns hasent propagated yet.
 * probably
 I've had the domain for a few months now
 * hasn't
 agh, the grammar! it burnz!
 you got the direct link Frank?
 for GAddar to try?
 im not exactly sure which blue iw ould use :P maybe even try another color
 cannot resolve grabs.uni.cc
 I think it's too over powering now - http://frankster.uni.cc/grabs/K4q9PFzTwYAwd07NFxdM.png
 What country are you in, Gaddar?
 turkey
 There is the other link ^
 frankster's fine.
 Thats weird :\
 Anyone else have a problem with grabs.uni.cc ?
 We had this with vndv one time
 certain countries in the middle-east area not having access
 @ kdigennaro I think its too overpowering now
 crappy dns infrastructure probably.
 Are grabs and franster on same host @Frank ??
 yes
 well play with it and balance it out :D
 OK, I'm gonna take a break from it for a while 
 bye frank :O
 Bye Frank 
 I'm not leaving
 lol
 I just said I was taking a break from designing
 oh :P
 But I do have to leave in a bit
 :O
 ok. i'll go watch some tarkovsky.
 and then get some more sleep.

 hay u guise
 you know the 'bug' in notepad, you save a txt file with the words "bush hid the facts" in it
 I'm pretty sure you spelled every word wrong in that sentence Pie :P
 its not just "bush hid the facts" its any 4 - 3 - 3 -5 word combination
 :P
 :O
 whats the bug pie?
 type bush hid the facts into a clean notepad file
 save it as anything.txt
 reopen it, its changed into nothing but blocks
 people thought its because of microsoft sticking up for bush
 haha
 but its acctually a bug in the IsTextUnicode function
 of nt 3.5
 you could save 'dick the ist stuff'
 and td do the same thing
 bye

 project is for the managing of an online radio station with a sponsor from evony.com, a rather large browser based game. for right now, it will be little to no payment... first month starting something is always tricky :P but when we get established, i estimate it has potential to bring in a good amount of revenue

 ^
 JaXm, sorry about the banner ad, I still will do it
 Jobs - Web Designer to keep the pages up to date, Scheduler to handle show times and DJ routines etc etc, Twitter, Facebook and all those things to manage and keep updated, Advertising managing, IRC admins, technical support, dj recruiting, media managing, membership tracking, news updates and someone for the mailing lists

 nope!
 I think somebody re-arranged my keys on the keyboard
 If you can remember where the letters are then you have no problem :-P
 ( I failed typing - when I was young never learned them - they had reference ready available on them)    http://zpcs.uuuq.com/index.html- can someone point me in the right direction - It cuts the top and bottom off the wick3d panel
 let me get a paste site ready to view - don't need an answer just a push in the right direction
   t(his is my first attempt at a from scratch css alignment )        http://pastesite.com/9569
 anyone push me in the right direction?
 yeah, get rid of the tables :x
 that's nothing to do with my alignment problem of the div id="wi" specifically is it, SP?
 it's probably due to the face that it's not in the table
 fact*
 but ew tables :X
 get rid of background-position and use margin: 0 auto;
 I wish I was a wizard from the get go but I find learning to deal with one unknown problem is easier than dealing with a multitude of sins of the get go I'm jus trying to incorporate a css to these two html's at the momnet and remove the huge panel from the html into a background and having the img *.gif float over the top of it
 boy these sentences are getting dangerousl close to the limit
 You think by moving the div into the bottom of the table might cure it, SP?
  or just going with the auto margin?
 try taking out the background-position elemnt in your CSS
 and try the margin: 0 auto;
 okay
 okay I see the confliction

 does it look bad? figured i could just put links to the 4 latest feeds or something
 can always swap them out for something else once i figure out wat else I want on the page lol
 I would rate it 9/10
 what happened to the pedophile bird?
 thanks frank :D better rating than i expected lol
 maybe at the lowest a 7.5 to an 8
 Meeso I put him back in his cage :P
 10/10
 oh good
 thought he was going to pop out of the screen and rape me :X
 Frank wat makes it a 7.5 if i may ask :D just want to improve it :D
 I want to try to make this layout a 10/10 :D
 I dont really care for the logo, maybe try to do something else to make it better :D
 agreed :D
 And also that dark brownish bar below the logo, the small red text is hard to read, and there isnt much stuff on it. Maybe try making it into a nav bar. 
 just gotta figure out wat lol
 thats a good suggestion but I dont really want to have a nav on this site
 i want pretty much everything just to be right ther

 In the past 12 months, you have received a large amount of money into your PayPal account. This is a courtesy reminder:
 An annual receiving limit of $3.300,00 USD is set by international law. If you reach the annual receiving limit, you will no longer be able to withdraw or send money until you complete the steps required to remove the limit.
 PayPal is required by law to comply with European Union Anti-Money Laundering regulations by collecting information from customers when they receive more than this limit. Please complete these steps as soon as possible.

 ok i have a music site and how we have it set up we have to upload the music directly to the ftp manually,and that is a pain. i was wondering if there was a way i can have users upload music to the ftp account for that music player?
 Uh I dont think that is allowed
 No mp3s in your ftp
 Not on this hosting, but is this a different host?
 Whey dolleh is about
 timmie :O
 :D
 http://www.rtmusic.org/remix.html <<, ok thats our site, we have to put music onto that ftp manually so we have music, can we have users uplaod music onto that liek ayoutube vido, so we dont have to do it manually
 My dad stopped paying maintanece today. So I now have to work full time. Pay rent to my ma and cnt afford uni

 Nvm
 aww :(
 I'm destined to work in tesco forever it would seem
 what do yall think of this http://kdiprovox.com/hosting?
 oops
 http://kdiprovox.com/hosting 
 xXWolfyXx: you can upload music via server-side scripting
 SHUT UP CREME
 Oh and my medical report says
 NO Dolleh 
 Neck: severe disibilty 
 Fail
 ok, how do i do that
 xXWolfyXx: depending on what your host supports, you could use PHP to handle a file sent via a HTML form
 but will it upload onto that music player?
 That depends, how does the music player find the music?  Just by looking at all the files in a given directory?
 Or something else
 its linked to your ftp
 our**
 That's not specific enough
 At the moment I'm making guesses about how this operates, and when I'm guessing I can't give any assurances or specific implementation details
 we have that music player linked directly to a ftp directory. So we just upload the music to that directory and it puts it on that music player
 Right, ok, so provided the web server has access to that directory
 You just need to have the script upload the file there
 And it would be equivalent
 where can i get soemthing liek that
 like**
 hey alex
 http://69.244.39.40/hh/final/ <-- whacha think?
 Any number of scripts on things like hotscripts if you want something premade
 But what you're describing is pretty simple, if you have any PHP experience I'd suggest you write your own
 me and php dont get along
 i am good with web designing adn flash, just not php

 hey Jacob
 I don't know what CPU's I'm meant to be getting because most sites don't list if its 64-bit
 Any idea which CPU?

 What about Intel?
 I hate AMD 
 Intel is better

 Bits
 NOt much though
 Jacob: Since when has "douche bag" been a swear word..?
 A douche is a device used to introduce a stream of water into the body for medical or hygienic reasons, or the stream of water itself.
 Douche usually refers to vaginal irrigation, the rinsing of the vagina, but it can also refer to the rinsing of any body cavity. A douche bag is a piece of equipment for douchingâa bag for holding the fluid used in douching. To avoid transferring intestinal bacteria into the vagina, the same bag must not be used for a vaginal douche and an enema.

 :P
 Heh, no GeoIP on that I guess, SP
 If there is NY isn't much of a guess
 no, but IT'S THE FUCKING WEATHER
 makes me lol everytime i visit it
 The only bit I find amusing
 Is that it says "ITS [sic] FUCKING NICE" and the forecast is "Scattered Thunderstorms"
 Nice for plants maybe
 wow...
 i got 69 degrees
 mine is 93?! ITS FUCKING HOT Uncontrolable swampass.
 so it said "Its Fucking Sexy Time"
 when i got in my car today the steering wheel was like a thousand degrees
 could barely touch it
 lol
 Defaulting to fahrenheit, oh dear, who still uses that silly scale ;)
 then i made the mistake of sticking my arm out the window and resting it on the metal exterior of the car
 AMERICA ALEX, FUCK YEAH
 Uneducated America* ;)
 lol @ the comment this time
 ITS FUCKING HOT, I just saw a fucking bird panting.
 I find it interesting
 That it says it's 27 degrees celsuis at the moment, and the forecast says high: 22 degrees
 it's accurate for my location
 I remain entirely unimpressed :p
 it's not meant to impress
 it's called the fucking weather lol
 Well, it's definitely not funny, so it's not going for that :p
 i think it's rather funny. damn brits and they're dry sense of humor
 their*
 SP
 Tim
 Whats funny?
 Oh
 http://thefuckingweather.com/
 the url?
 And thats funny why :p ?
 Heh, you know you guys envy us our real sense of humour.  This is why we have real comedy
 you guys are too serious in here lol
 I wouldn't go for the weight thing personally, we're still somewhat behind America you're right, but we're worst in Europe
 I don't think that's much of a high ground ;)
 it's the easy road out for people who don't actually feel like debating the differences.
 I suppose you would know about bailing from a debate ;)

 Bass_Guitar, if it's not channel related, then hand the logs to an oper and let them deal with it.
 Yea..
 it was channel related..
 creme probably started whining via pm :p
 but its not like anyone is bgoing to object to him being banned ? ;-)
 <Cr`eme> DarkKrai stfu please
 isnt that starting?
 That doesn't warrant a ban in here... nevermind in #hosting
 something
 :s
 i didnt ban him in #hosting
 oh yeah i did :P
 forgot
 * Bass_Guitar sets ban on *!*Creme@*.uuuq.com
 :p
 That's barely banter, you didn't even warn him.
 whatever.. doesn't matter to me
 personally i dont think creme warrants being warned anymore -_-
 ^
 he really contributes absolutely nothing
 I agree
 It would be a rather empty channel if that was some kind of rule :/
 at some point you have to realize this guy is fucking annoying to everyone and give him the boot
 ^
 what irks my most is he thinks everyone is talking to him
 all the time
 brb
 back
 *sigh* Will you do us a favour and stay away a bit longer DarkKrai
 wb DarkKrai
 that too
 nah Dave... i really havent seen any single person annoy people as much as he does
 If it REALLY bothers you.. and I mean REALLY, you would have /ignored by now.
 hes gone for like 2 minutes :x
 Seems none of you have.
 So what he says is irrelevant.
 but then others would be replying to him and text would be out of context
 yeah
 that doesn't work because you only get half of conversations
 then hed get upset
 and complain
 damn
 you two cut the drama
 leave each other alone
 I try
 but I get pms
 Everyone needs to grow up a bit. Annoying people exist in life. Deal with it.
 you should only be getting pms once a month
 i'd get that checked out by your OB GYN

 This room turned into a bunc of cunts to be quite frank
 And sorry to be blunt.

 Quite frankly they are just attention-wanting abused kids.
 Sad to see them resort to coming in here.
 Isn't Jacob some extremist youth Christian thing?
 Nope

 What message did he notice?
 trolling or flooding?
 lol it has a troll sensor?
 Yes
 how would one trigger that

 Just be normal SP, I'm sure you'll manage it ;)

 question Alex or Robert.. If you owned a webhosting company would you host the site for Kevin Mitnick or Dan Kaminsky    ?
 !google Kevin Mitnick

 @(-,,-)@
 Possibly
 hey Juw
 Hai TheOracle:)
 From those short snippits it seems they've now gone legit
 So yes
 Both were hacked the other week.
 Ah
 I have heard of the second guy, so probably there :p
 but Robert.. Both are targets of any person who wants to get their name in the news.
 They were both recently hacked the other week in a zero for owned zine.
 Mitnick's webhost (who was exploited) actually told mitnick they wouldnt host him any more as they were becoming targets of hackers.
 Kaminsky had most of his emails stolen lol.

 TheSharpieOne can you help me ?
 or s.o. to help me
 on what?
 i`m trying to install a joomla on my web space but i get only this " Unable to connect to the database:Could not connect to MySQL "
 look
 your problem's probably this
 when you create a database user, it's user name actually becomes  domain_user
 for example
 my domain is tiyatro.vndv.com
 and my database user is gaddar
 so my actual db user name is tiyatro_gaddar
 probably this is the problem
 i`ll try like this with my username w8 
 bout what time does jack usually pop online?
 i have no idea.

 Pie` do you have fsockopen() enabled?
 krisives, ofc

 Did you know you can just use file_get_contents() to get the entire document?
 everyhting is enabled ^_^
 i dont want the entire document though
 im posting data
 file_get_contents('http://blah')
 $file = fsockopen('80.87.131.193', 80, $errno, $errstr, 99);
 fwrite($file, "POST /pastebin.php HTTP/1.0

 You can post data with file_get_contents as well
 Oddly enough
 I know you can witih fopen() at least

 Tim|iPhone, 
 No curl Pie`?

 guess not
 help me i cant connect to vndv.com host
 MMateo: horeyyy, hehe
 Can't you install it Pie`? :p
 never tried tbh
 but  just dont udnerstand why my sockets are all timing out
 What's the whole request?
 Ed: http://ghdfhdfhdfhfhfghdfghdfh.pastebin.com/m3edc0f11
 client speed(bandwidth) problem
 is that a valid POST action ?
 Hardcode the new lines
 \r\n or just \n
 Plus the last one should be \r\n\r\n
 \r\n is just for compatibility with windows servers
 So yeah, \r\n
 I'm not sure about your additional headers too, I imagine they'll fail
 well it gave me a HTTP/1.1 200 OK
 Those meant to be form fields Pie`?
 Ed: yeah
 I'm trying to make a script to post to pastebin
 so my irc bot i can just !pastebin stuff
 and itll give a url
 `length parent_id=&format=text&code2=test&poster=Phot
 Length: 45
 all: sound like AI (xAIML) 
 Sorry phone call. Yeah, that post request is COMPLETELY wrong
 Ed, just fiddled with it
 its now:
 fwrite($file, "POST: /pastebin.php HTTP/1.0\r\nUser-Agent: Phot/2.0\r\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\nContent-Length: 45\r\nparent_id=&format=text&code2=test&poster=Phot\r\n\r\n")
 Need to define the host too
 Host: pastebin.com
 bad request
 If I were you, I'd break down the request so it's on separate lines, it's easier to see what you're doing wrong.
 Request header field is missing colon separator.
 parent_id=&format=text&code2=test&poster=Phot
 have i missed something?
 oh yeah i did
 you need Request: before the fields
 the request recieved was "OK" but it didnt get pasted ><
 Pie`: http://ghdfhdfhdfhfhfghdfghdfh.pastebin.com/m4570f2f3 
 That should be the request
 er wait, ignore the \r\n at the end
 Ed: http://ghdfhdfhdfhfhfghdfghdfh.pastebin.com/m3c63e6d2
 that's what it looks like now
 hey all
 btw, you need Request: otherwise it errors
 Isn't needed... anything after \r\n\r\n is considered the packet's payload
 You don't need the ':' after POST either
 POST /pastebin.php HTTP/1.1
 Or 1.0
 Ed: I'm not quite sure what exactly its doing because anything returned is always exactly the same results
 always exactly the same posts, no time difference
 What does the socket come back with?

 <3 TamperData addon for firefox :D
 HttpFox is pretty for firefox
 Tamperdata I found doesn't work too well with post requests with binary data
 whats it do, list the headers/
 Tamper? Tamper lets you inject xyz into the requests before they're sent
 ah
 HttpFox lists cookies, headers, payloads etc, packet sniffer basically.
 cool
 you have firebug i trust :p
 Just a bit better imo than Livehttpheaders
 Yep, couldn't get along without firebug at times.
 OPera's offering of Dragonfly isn't bad though
 havent used opera in quite a while
 should get it again..
 Opera's so under rated.
 it was a very nice browser when i used it
 i just miss the plugins of firefox when I use it
 Which ones?
 if opera gets a plugin database on par with FF, they'd have a real competitor
 firebug mainly
 Dragonfly works pretty well
 although i could just use FF to debug and opera for general browsing
 That's basically my setup, Opera is my main browsers
 *browser
 adblock plus as well
 Then got two instances of Firefox one is my secure one (noscript) the other is my normal debug version
 I don't agree with adblock, I don't think it's right to take away the only revenue source from a website
 to each their own, i'm not a fan of ads :p
 No one is, but that's what pays for the website ;)
 i never ever click them anyway, so they're only getting my impressions
 I click on the for the lulz

 im still looking for phpbb3 geniuses
 M1st3rm4n
 I'm pro ;-)
 :O
 let me ask you a question
 Hey Mcgurrin.
 do you know the phpbb3 arcade made by jeff?
 I am doing a reunion site for a former school, I already have a forum and a picture gallery, does anyone have any suggestions for further things that would improve the site?
 a website
 Hi Brandon
 DarkKrai what do you mean?
 lol
 !quote Mcgurrin
 sBot? :o
 oh my, I just got 1.5 to 2.0 Mbytes/s on a single download
 Anyone here on Virgin broadband ?
 no
 does anyone remember the name of the new york cable company offering uncapped 98Mbit (I think that was it) cable internet?
 Brandon, are you at home or at a university or buisness
 Okay, well. I found out today if you have the 10mb connection then you actually have the 20 and if you have the 50mb one you have the 100mb connection, lucky bastards.
 Mcgurrin, are you some kind of pervert? .. If you need to know I'm all alone in my bedroom half naked ;-).
 no, I was just asking as usually businesses and universities have faster internet than a home does
 Brandon, only half? Thats not like you ;)
 Happy ;-)
 :/
 very.
 Mcgurrin begins installing freebsd on virtual machine in attempt to make better local testing server
 Dave and Dolleh
 my evening is complete
 :3
 Woop
 :)
 ADMIT IT DAVE
 YOU MISSED ME
 hey Tim
 TIMMIE! :D:D
 Tim: hows the vw camper ?
 good
 Brandon :D
 oh, on the issue of the internet connection the most I have been able to get over wifi internally is about 3Mbytes a second so 2/3 of that from the internet I like a lot
 ego... pfft
 Hippie much, Tim :o
 Brandon :D
 (How ever it's spelt)
 Mcgurrin, be lucky you get that much
 Dave?
 You're gay.
 i don't get even 05mb/s over wired.
 0.5mb/s *
 You wish.
 Noooooo
 lol
 Dave wants you Brandon
 #facr
 fact*
 Understandable, should have seen what he was saying last night :-O
 Pie, so you are like my school, our T1 Router is still a 10mbit hub, a HUB (though we will soon change that to a business cable connection and better router I am told)
 :o
 :O
 Whats this Brandon
 im having a bad deay for design :(
 day*
 PASTE!
 Me too, Hastings
 Every day for Brandon :)
 brandon don't you hate that? im angry, lol. i just gave up on design for the day, gonna try to get some ruby learnin' in.
 i dont go in days i go in months
 i have like
 a good 2 months
 then a HORRIBLE 8 months
 Oh really Dave
 You lost #1 postion in the fan club
 and thats when i usually disappear from #zymic for a while, like righ tin the middle of that 8 months of badness
 tut tut
 lol
 :-P
 I meant every day was a bad day for design....
 ^ Tim
 sure dave..
 ALL LIES!
 Dolleh :p don't sneak up and stab me in the back :(
 Too late.

 greedy cats all over me D< GET OFF MY CHAIR HAIRY FURRBALL!!!!
 I find it interesting that since I last restarted and have read from hdd written to hdd and recieved from the network several times the capacity of my hard drive each
 now lets see if he comes back to play
 :d
 BTW what kind of HDDs are in the servers here, they must be large for the storage allowed each?
 probably
 6G a person is a LOT
 lol
 yeah actually just shy of 6GB but still it is quite a bit
 NOW for coffee!
 i'm having the most... er.. interesting convo with my lil bro he's in his room, i'm in mine, he yells "OMG its a BIGFOOT!" I go "holy shit its a BIGFOOT" 
 my FreeBSD installation is going a lot better on my current attempt than my previous attempts now that I have the new version of VirtualBox
 we are retarded
 hey
 anyone know any good web based server management packages that are free?  I found one that I might try out but I am open to ideas
 hello
 Mcgurrin: Any reason you need it web based?
 Learning to use cli purely is never a bad idea.
 What's CLI?
 Command line interface
 Oh.
 I would like it to be as this will be in a VM and I want to basically start the VM then minimize it and work, and I want it to be easy
 ISPConfig and Webmin are free, not sure if the former works on FreeBSD
 Ok, The one I was looking at was Webmin so I guess that should work
 i really need to learn regex
 Should do Mcgurrin
 Pie`:
 It's not all that hard
 Brandon, i just dont understand it / know where to start :p
 Easy enough Pie`, I find this quite useful : http://regexlib.com/CheatSheet.aspx
 Damn you, Ed! Was just getting that >.>
 `ping
 PONG
 ^[A-Za-z]+^
 That means that if whatever is being search
 starts with A-Z or a-z any number of times yes?
 You can't end with '^'
 it seems to work if i end with ^ :D
 but if i remove ^ it says no ending delimiter
 Warning: preg_match() [function.preg-match]: No ending delimiter '^' found in C:\xampp\htdocs\pastebin\regex.php on line 2
 Yeah, don't use ^ for that :p
 ^ is a special character, you want it to be usable
 # or / are normally used for delimiters
 #[a-z]+#i is how I'd probably write that
 #regex#modifiers or /regex/modifiers
 Which is at least one a-z or A-Z character
 but don't i want ^ at the start, so itl match the string at the start ?
 Not "any number of times", which is "*" instead of "+"
 * allows there to be 0 of that block
 ^ isn't required as the string becomes the subject so technically, ^ and $ is assumed by the delimiters
 For A-Za-z there's ctype_alpha() if you're just testing
 !phpdoc ctype_alpha
 Oh, no sbot
 I wouldn't do that here, the colour stripping messes it up anyway, Ed
 soo... #[A-Z]+#
 mathing any A-Z
 mre than 1 time
 At least one time
 Rob wrote in support for channels without colours Alex 
 so it degrades
 Yeah, but then I think he went back to an older version
 ah
 Last time I saw it it didn't work
 Pie`: so "A" would be accepted by that
 One or more A-Z characters, not more than one
 thats what i meant
 Fair enough, it is an important distinction though :p
 #[^aeiou]+#
 will match anyhting that doesnt contain aeiou ?
 Apart from the empty string

 http://dznr.org/5egb
 it annoys me when people do read the API's for things and then try to make stuff that has already been done
 ?
 cool Tim
 :D
 e.g. this person on a forum i go on, has made a php script which selects a random value from an array of values
 lol
 he neglected to search/read the api and discover there is a function ready made to select a random value for him
 sounds like Creme
 Alex: pastesite is nearly upto 10k pastes :o
 or at least, 5 digit ids :p
 DarkKrai: http://pastesite.com/9647
 that's what I'm talking about -.-
 Well, it means there have been that many
 But with deletions, and timed pastes
 It's just over 9000 that are still there
 Alex, you should make an api or something for it
 make it easy to paste from outside applications
 An API for what?  Simple enough to do via cURL
 yeah, but not everyone knows how to use cURL, or post via a socket
 I only just figured out how to post via socket today :p
 And these people would know how to use an API?
 an api is often easier
 Not much
 not unless the libraries are prebuilt

 what table type in mysql would i use to store an IP adress
 Mufia, do you mean column type?
 Yeah
 i store them as a varchar
 Sorry
 varchar is letters tho?
 is it not?
 varchar is a string
 putting an ip into a varchar field is the equivalent of doing
 $ip = "127.0.0.1";
 i see
 trice, go back to bed! NOW!

 from creme
 boyz27, where are you hosted?
 is creme hosting you?
 lol
 ya
 lol
 why "lol"?
 i wouldnt suggest him
 he doesnt know a thing about what hes doing
 you should use zymic or another freehost
 Creme isnt very reliable either, he usually changes projects every month
 mm here
 ?
 boyz27, if creme was a good webhost he would at least have his own customer support station that was monitored 24/7, not an irc hosted by someone else that is only ever monitor for a few hours a day

 Good day all
 But for a fee that's pretty expensive ;p. I know that if you take like 20p more than what's in your account halifax will charge like Â£30 O_o, that's if you're with Halifax ofcourse

 hey anyone know a better coda slider? =/
 coda slider ?
 jaxm :O
 =D
 brandon http://www.ndoherty.com/demos/coda-slider/1.1.1/
 Why a better one? :/
 brandon stfu
 lol
 just sto
 lol
 grr
 Nothing wrong with it.
 Alright, let's rephrase Brandon's query from my point of view
 Define "better"
 alex - it comes with zero instructions and makes no sense integration-wise, something better coded
 >_< :@:@
 sldkfja
 f
 r
 Ok, we can do without the keyboard mashing, cheers
 Hmm
 I don't know a great many javascript effect tools
 But you could do something equivalent fairly easily with jQuery or similar
 And that /does/ have good documentation
 http://clients.crownstyles.com/hostfromNeT/ < See the little slider at the bottom, Hastings?
 brandon, yes, but it needs to have numbers
 its tabs for diff pages on a single page
 You know how to code..
 Stop being lazy!
 no... no i dont
 not js
 Back
 im djing now if anyone wants to tune in =D
 jaxm what kind of tunes
 rock mainly... and of course theres a request function on the site :P
 if you play "cut like a buffalo" by the dead weather, ill tune in.
 :P
 lol never heard of em... but ill find it ;)
 its jack white's new band
 good stuff
 Shit.
 "You know I love like a woman but I cut like a buffalo, stand up like a tower, tall, then fall just like a domino"
 ^ good stuff
 It "cut like a buffalo" some cultural thing, or is it as weird as it sounds? :p
 lol ok ill play it... your gonna tune in then?
 As a phrase
 don't know what is connection between love a woman with cut a buffalo
 jaxm link
 alex tune in its a good song
 http://evonyradio.com
 no its not rituals... lol
 im tuned
 Got my own music on at the moment, if it becomes important I'm sure I can find it ;)
 But I can't say I consider Jack White much of a positive start :p
 White Stripes don't rank high for me
 I'm listening 
 if ya wanna put in a request, go to http://evonyradio.com/request.php
 =D
 btw your site needs redesign JaXm
 i know its not perfect
 it's broken in ff
 how?
 the nav bar is behind the main content
 o.0
 uhm... screenshot it

 =D

 JaXm: http://tawjee3i.uuuq.com/Screenshot.png
 Can anyone tell me what to use for Database Server name if your on the vdnv.com server
 [21:40:34] * %Brandon is listening to "WJXM Radio Station - DJ JaXm" streaming "Within Temptation - Running Up That Hill". 64kbps MP3
 64KBPS ?!?!?!!?
 EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
 should be at least 128...
 at the VERY least
 otherwise its not music, just horrible noises
 im so sorry that i dont want to spend an extra $10 more a month
 64 is fine
 I am installing osCommerce and it requires me to enter the Database Server name but I dont know if I put it like website.vndv.com or just vndv.com or what
 Block party = win. Some times
 who else hate these "hey, is this you?? http://friends.myspaces-gallery.com/"
 yea rebel... im not sure what happened to yours... think its your browser thats messing the page up
 http://avanix.uni.cc/images/evony.png looks fine here
 kubuntu 9.04 with latest swiftfox
 not likely JaXm
 anyone else got ff here ?
 uhm... im using ff
 :S
 rebel, I'm using ff
 ive never had anyone else point that out... your the first
 this is weird
 anyone use ubuntu here ?
 me
 yea rebel... thats not even the same font that im using
 well maybe it is... but either way, your browser is messed up lol
 btw this song sounds cool
 DarkKrai: do you have problems with flash ?
 flash is slow on my ff
 yeah
 when I run flash cpu goes up to 8o%
 then, it crashes ff when I close the tab its in
 does that happen to you too?
 also, it has no sound
 sometimes everything flash stop working 
 and instead white box appears 
 then I have to restart firefox
 from downloading too much porn i think
 what's that got to do with flash?
 hey Tim
 Hello
 Oh look Dolleh
 :)
 http://evonyradio.com/tunein.php
 JaXm: do you have anything Jazz?
 timmie :D
 timmie, you have had blue hair! :D
 :O
 yes!

 uploading :D
 i'll PM it XD
 not really rebel
 blue hair?
 blue hair! :D
 never heard of em
 this station mainly does rock... sure we have some other types to mix it up a bit... but its mainly rock
 Dolleh: you have blue hair?
 nope 
 never had either, i'm boring, only had purple once...lol....
 haha
 o.0
 and orange.. wich was a fail
 damn crossfade
 hi
 purchased hosting over 2 days ago
 still waiting on a reply
 send emails
 no answer
 wtf is going on..
 you should try your questions in #hosting
 just type /join #hosting
 its advertising for zymic
 not hosting.
 Youre doing it wrong
 you need to first main screen turn on
 then, get signal
 We don't supply paid hosting
 rage, please join #hosting
 ^
 ADVERTISING
 yeah, wrong place, bucko
 is #hosting for advertising?!
 We'll discuss it there
 ...
 no
 wow...
 No, it's for problems with the hosting
 ok let me find a url to make this easier for you
 ....
 woah-ho bigshot
 http://www.zymic.com/website-traffic/
 sorry but after 2 days of no response from a company
 it starts to become an issue
 That's done by a referral system
 Jack
 It's for you...
 sorry robert missed your last line
 in hosting
 You need to talk to Jack
 ok so Jack?
 i've emailed jack
 i've been in here 3 times
 JaXm: what software you are using ?
 but Jack seems to be hard to find.
 *facepalm*
 indeed.
 Shoutcast rebel
 how much do you pay for hosting ?
 all im after is the service i paid for over 48 hours ago or at least some kind of response from the admin that manages it
 $5.95 currently
 gotta disappear for a bit, pick the woman up - back in about an hour
 so there is one person and one person only that can help me?
 probably
 Jack is a very busy man... he has alot of issues to take care of
 yeah ok
 so am i
 and im a paying customer
 ok...
 if it was free then ok
 but when i've forked out $, had no reply, no information or anything its a bit concerning
 and how long does it say it takes to be setup?
 it mentions nothing of setup but as per previous dealings with hosting, advertising and general online companies
 JaXm: do you get any stats on how many people are listening ?
 i have found that 48 hours with no reply is a bit of a joke.
 worrying..
 yes rebel i do have stats for it
 how many?
 back
 right now? i reset the stats when i changed the name of the station
 had to completely reinstall McAFee
 sroracle, you deal with advertising at all?
 no
 ffs
 previously i had 9 listener peak and 298 unique listeners since it started
 wow rage you need to take a chill pill...
 ya
 rly
 erm no
 you seriously sound like your about 12
 rage, you should type in CAPS to get your point across
 r3411y

 :)
 :O oh nice
 *sigh* TO....this are no girls T_T worse even
 someone reposted me on soup.io :D :D :D
 Dolleh: perras haha
 this channel first of all is for general chat... not to get help for issues
 perra's indeed ;D
 or tho, perra
 damn, hes still here
 you were directed to #hosting wich would be the place to GET HELP... yet you left and continued it in here before there was any chance to try and discuss your issue
 thought he would get dealt with
 JaXm you dumb fuck
 darkkrai, ignore it T_T
 woot
 i went to hosting
 they told me
 its not a hosting issue
 just like i told you ugys
 rage WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE
 its not
 Dolleh:

 http://th3ufo.soup.io/post/25234747
 :D
 fair call Dolleh
 he reposted me!
 DarkKrai, then why send me there?
 on the ball
 ooo the handsome family ;D
 lmfao
 hehe
 ok... so you went to hosting, he said one thing... and without giving him any time to give you any other alternative methods to fixing this... you left
 erm no 
 he said 'its to hard to talk in 2 channels' or something to the like
 so i said 'lets go back to zymic'
 <Robert> I can't read two screens at once
 i know its probably hard for you to read with a 5th level education
 yea... you said that and then just left instantly after it
 go back to your radio station
 you can be the next Kyle Sandilands
 hey, the channel for this is #advertisement
 yep
 oh wait, no ignorant fuckers allowed
 really, so whats your plan then? pack your shit up and get out?
 ya know what... i think i am gonna go back to my radio station... and promote it properly without having to PAY to get web traffic
 maybe if i just stay here
 lol
 oh i see JaXm
 he needs traffic for his gay porn site
 so what your saying is
 so the fact remains, your still a tool and you should go drink a pint of bleach
 i should backcharge jack
 tell him to fuck off
 and not pay for his advertising
 Hey fuck heads

 Freenode is for tools
 There is so many people on there
 Alex: I have been having issues getting my hostmask to work recently
 * *** Looking up your hostname...
 * *** Couldn't resolve your hostname; using your IP address instead
 Can't resolve
 Is this a DNS issue?
 That shouldn't be any real problem
 It should connect anyway
 Any ideas?
 Are you talking about the vhost?
 Yep.
 Because what you pasted has nothing to do with the vhost
 The thing is I think, your vhost was under narzy, which has expired
 Ah
 okies.
 I see the problem
 So the vhost went with it
 What was the vhost?
 jacobbednarz.com
 I was also thinking for staff - staff.zymic.com
 as a vhost
 Hmmm, actually found Narzy, it's still there though it is under that nick
 Jacob is grouped isn't it?
 Should be
 I'll add it for Jacob as well
 Cool
 Thanks bud
 /msg hostserv on
 Ah
 cool
 So now when I ident, it should work?
 morning
 ha
 Hello
 hello guys
 Yes, it should work anyway, not sure why it stopped might just be that setting it on again would have worked
 oh Jacob that cannot resolve hostname is a commong thing on irc... doesnt really mean anything ;)
 Cool.
 I thought it was that it couldn't resolve
 vhosts don't resolve ;)
 nah i get it all the time... its just the way your identifying yourself to the server when ya connect... i dont mean by nickserv ;)
 I thought; because the IP was in use instead, the vhost might not work
 megamonk, you had a problem with something earlier ?
 Would do, if they worked by host, but they're linked to the nickserv system
 yup
 have you fixed it yet?
 its kinda annoying really
 not yet
 what's the problem ?
 :(
 So I will just turn it on again if I have that issue
 we cant help you unless we know what the problem is
 i get error 500 internal server error whener i run a php file.. running an html files works though
 *whenever
 htaccess issue
 ^
 What is your domain?
 nope...
 500 usually points to your htaccess ;)
 i checked my htaccess and php,ini
 Lmao.
 php.ini on Zymic?
 i already know the problem... the problem is i cant do anything about it :(
 no its on lunar

 theres one XD
 I want to host a competition for my company
 lol
 Hey Jack
 I got a question
 Is it possible for me to host a competition? There will be prize
 Hello
 :/
 OMFG D: too much creme
 :P
 LOL
 What did you do to them Cr`eme 
 I clicked Xchat Twice
 Not many people are fond of you
 :P
 Great
 back
 TO :O
 Welcome back TO
 :D
 hey
 :D
 :-/
 Hey TheOracle 
 BRB updating FIREFOX on this computer
 Don't leave us Sazzad!
 ah, I did that a few days ago, its much faster! :D
 Dolleh, :D
 It is fast
 D: ONOES
 %quit new python lookup module
 TO D: hide me, the kid is sssssscary D:

 %py eval
 TheOracle: eval(expression[, globals[, locals]]) The arguments are a string and optional globals and locals.
 I have that code too :D
 Lies
 he stole it
 I haven't pasted my code anywhere nob
 :)
 It isnt in python
 it is in PHP :P
 No you idiot
 it is in python
 Nope
 Yes
 No! D<
 Besides, I bet you can't tell the two apart
 Yes I can :P
 Lies
 D<
 if you couldn't figure out a mIRC script, you sure as hell can't tell python/PHP apart
 :P ROFL
 PHP has <?php in the beginning and ?> in the end and python doesnt have that O<
 PHP doesn't always have them, if you just use an include()
 True that
 And you could have require "";
 O_o
 Dog is howling XD
 :)
 PHP using the cli won't have the open/close tags either
 :D
 hello
 Could I use a MYSQL server that is server1.somedomain.com or does it have to be on that server
 from what server?
 if you are hosting here you can only use the localhost mysql server
 Like If I am running my bot from my house
 And I want to use a nother mysql server
 could I do that?
 That isnt localhost
 then if you have a mysql server with a firewall not blocking it then yes
 OK :D
 for instance my project mysql server on sf.net for one of them is mysql-f.sourceforge.net I believe
 ok
 T_T
 I have to switch computers

 I used to use WampServer when my primary machine was a windows box, now I use XAMPP on my mac
 I love XAMPP
 It is awesome
 and it starts autmatically
 So I am reinstalling it again
 does anyone know any reason for multiple linux distros would all fail at select and install software on 2 different types of VMs on the same machine
 :O>-<
 it has happened to me and I would really like to get a testing server vm setup
 For some reason VM never worked for me
 :(
 Is port forwarding bad
 Because I heard people can host jack
 Cr`eme, you need to port forward if you want to host stuff
 I knoe
 But Jacob said that people can host Jack or someething like that with a script
 and isnt that bad?
 if it was so easy to host jack with a forwarded port
 then the option wouldnt be built into routers
 Oh OK :D
 But I dont know how to port forward so it doesnt matter T_T
 theres probably an option like "virtual servers" or something on your router
 make a new entry
 select socket type, udp/tcp
 and port range
 Oh ok

 I've already gotten two emails from forums I'm a member of saying happy birthday
 hmm
 well he's obviously been completely drunk for the past 24 hours
 I'm trying to go out tonight but I'm poor
 oh god no, white is dreadful there o_O
 Getting money tomorrow and getting paid friday
 so I'll just make it a huge birthday weekend
 ahh save it for the weekend?
 ahh yeh ;) 
 blow all your money in one night :p
 haha I don't know if I could blow near a grand in one night
 I wouldn't have the heart to
 between my check and what i'm getting tomorrow I should have just at a grand, or just over
 easily done ;)
 I'm sure it is, and I'm sure i'll blow alot of it, i'm buying a new phone tomorrow so thats $150 gone right there
 model?
 Samsung instinct
 ic
 I really want the damn thing, already flashed for MetroPCS, metro is a local unlimited phone company... it's like $55 a month for unlimited everything
 http://www.metropcs.com/
 right now i'm on the 40 dollar plan because my phone is internet capable, but because of the way they flashed it, it won't connect to the internet
 It was my old Sprint, LG LX550 (Fusic) phone
 I love the thing but it is falling apart
 and isn't as badass as the instinct
 damnit
 I can't find good colors
 how do these look?
 http://sresp.co.cc/
 Is ShoutCast permited on the servers?
 SUP
 3 hours and I am 18
 awesome Jacob
 YEEEEWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
 going to get fucked up
 rofl
 having a big birthday bash ?:P
 yep
 Tomorrow night
 Then going clubbing
 does anyone here know how to get the url of a youtube video without the use of an application
 I don't understand your question
 I want the URL of the actual video, not a page to watch it on
 I suggest starting by looking at the page code...
 yeah, I've tried that many times and failed
 I know the video extension is flv, but there are 0 occurences of "flv" in the source
 flash grab?
 FF plugin
 whats it do ?
 grabs flv files
 it is a FF plugin
 I use it at work a fair bit
 does appear to be in the addons list ><
 https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search?q=flash+grab

 hello guys
 hello megamonk 
 the problem witn my hosting finally got solved :D
 Which was?
 the "error 500 internal server error" thingy
 damn suphp and damn stupid admin they have
 Anyways, what brings you here?
 nothing really... just good talk with knowledgeble people
 ah ha
 i kinda like the atmosphere here... you know everyone is a techie yet you see them act (and talk) dumb
 :D
 alright
 I am about to pwn some freak on freenode
 and i kinda like the usuall conversation where dolleh gets hit by everyone else hahahahaha
 :O
 who hits Dolleh-brb ?
 i really dont know but i feel at home here even though i know im the farhest away from everyone else
 That's too deep for Zymic
 You need a councillor
 nah, i just need someone to screw with sometimes :D
 :/
 life is tough here in my place
 im usually overworked and underpaid :((
 Aren't we all
 this is my place of bliss... in a weird sort of way :)
 Wow. You must hate your life
 ffs
 I have to go to bed
 not really... i just hate people who dont appreciate things that we developers do
 Not everyone is like that, megamonk... and half the people can't really be called technically competent ;)
 Girlfriend has started on me again
 *coughs* Cr`eme
 lol
 *coughs* DarkKrai
 pppsh
 *coughs* Ed
 *pssh
 ;)
 *coughs* Jacob 
 alex is here
 D:<
 No need to hide there, after that one it would be power abuse :p
 And as noted, I happen to be watching
 hehehe
 :D
 Alex: Your kinda creepy
 You just pop up sometimes
 Out of no where
 and then hide again
 You're*
 guise, some gay guy thats too fruity for me likes me. He uses linux. whats the best way to f*ck up his machine?
 And what do you expect when I don't disconnect
 Alex: did you do anything for the Zymic site/panel, etc?
 sudu
 pour water on his cpu
 lol
 Apart from helping to provide content, no
 I mean, like a command he could typ
 The site was Mark's work
 Mark was a nut
 I have seen some of his code
 He caters for /everything/
 so IRC is your home and baby?
 ask him to type "sudo rm -rf /"
 something less obvious
 he might know
 Tell him it changes it back to Windws
 use an alias
 windows*
 I dont know his technical skills
 he hates windows
 Besides, wiping his hard drive is a tad too harsh
 most fruity people use windows
 naw...
 I don't appreciate that command being used as anything but an obvious jest.
 :(
 use an alias to hide the command 'sudo rm -rf /'... like sudo im_good
 lol
 There are a number of reasonably cryptic things, like fork bombs
 Which just require a reset
 Alex, he hit on me though D:
 DarkKrai attracts all the guys
 :x
 and dogs too :D
 But I think the ideal solution here, is to get over it ;)
 Why so diplomatic Alex ?
 WE NEED A RATIONAL THINKER!
 maybe hes running for public office :D
 Get Ed whilst sleep deprived; that will work
 He will want to pwn left right and centre
 or steal his girlfriend.. if he has any :D
 Yes, he has two
 They are called UUUQ.com and VNDV.com
 He has a few bitchin ex's though
 clanteam, zxq.net, zzl.org, zymichost.com, and some others
 those 2 are b*tches... they serve far too many guys online WHAHAHAHAHA!!!
 and they do it for free :D
 anyways
 I am off
 Night all
 are you still here jacob? aint it like.. bedtime?
 Great, now you're going to leave me with this bunch of degenerates Jacob... thanks... thanks ALOT!

 Went for a meeting with a new client; a construction company. Pulled up at the address - they're using one of their new show houses as their offices - outside was a parked m3, 911, range rover and an x5.
 I near died when I parked up beside the m3
 lemme guess, you were surrounded by 5 drug dealers who wanted their money back, you busted them up, and busted a few caps on them, right
 oh...
 It's so gorgeous
 Close DarkKrai...

 all day working this out
 I've gone from $500-1000/day to $60 over night, this is how worrying this is
 They rang me asking for a proxy site, then when I spelt it... they where like Ohhh hide my ass, i had no idea what you where saying.
 Jack, I'll visit your site
 I will give someone a lot of money if they find out
 :|
 I am *this* close to snapping my laptop in half
 :(
 I could understand if revenue went down slowly overtime
 but not over night
 something is really weird
 You haven't been blocked by some country have you?
 or major ISP?
 china? :D
 18....wwwwhhhhhhaaaaaahhhhooooo
 No but checking
 traffic has not dropped
 And like you have to register before you pay
 And registration rates are similar too
 so people are not paying
 seems to be a payment provider issue maybe
 cheapos
 but nothing to suggest
 Ahh :/

 I want to report a site that doesn't obey the vndv's agreement
 What site is it Pedram?
 douda.vndv.com
 hey, thats my site!
 lol
 is it? really
 NO
 oops
 man that is one ugly website
 what rule is it breaking Pedram 
 chatrooms I think
 its not hosted to zymics server
 like, using zymic as a server
 its a web client
 by the way it's a really crappy site
 What is?
 douda.vndv.com
 I spammed
 Yea.. I agree.
 lol
 have a nice time everybody
 Thanks Pedram
 We try not though..
 Someone tell DarkKrai stop harassing me the fgt!
 D:
 you know you love me
 DarkKrai stop harassing Brandon
 Go harass Cr`eme mk?
  
 <DarkKrai> hey brandon bear = harrassment? S:
 hey
 awwe, roscoe is asleep on my lap
 :D
 http://takeatee.com/
 How nerdy
 hehe
 kernel panic shirt
 lol
 DarkKrai, who is 'roscoe' ? :/
 my puppy!
 :D
 What a shitty name to have :/.
 D:
 I didnt choose it
 I don't see what's so bad about naming a cute puupy dog Roscoe, can't be any worse than naming an adoracle bavy Brandon
 bavy = baby
 adorable*
 Where are you from ZARDOZ?
 Roscoe was probably named after the famous Dog from the Dukes of Hazzard: Roscoe P. Coltrain
 yeah
 thats it
 my dad named him that :x
 :-P.
 My dog is named "Beast" :)
 we got him in Alabama so its appropriate xD
 he was free, a purebred chihuahua awwe
 yup yup
 My dog is named "Digger"
 Chihuahua.. x'D/
 comes from when he diggs up moles and snaps their necks
 DarkKrai is for sure gay.
 haha
 be pretty hard to get your Beast and Dgger to be lap dogs, they must be big dogs?
 Digger*
 lol, guise, I have another dog
 hes a pit bull D:<
 Zardoz: Actually no
 He's smaller than you'd think
 he's the size of a terrier
 oh that's a good mix for buds, Spike and Mike DarkKrai
 :x
 Roscoe and Willie
 :D
 yup yup
 okay, TO
 I got a herd of attack cats
 he's old and grumpy nowadays though
 They chase the neighbors dog around the back yard when she jumps the fence after the cats intimidate her
 heh
 my brother has a Great Dane (his) and a Chihuahua (my sister in law's)
 So when they're side-by-side its like the world's largest and smallest dogs
 DarkKrai what are you doing
 got to get a pic sometime when they're sitting side by side looking diff directions if possible
 idk
 I'm sure they're one around here
 they're both brindle, you see
 so they look like they're related
 Don't know what's largest, but chihuahua's are the second smallest I think.  And pretty ugly little dogs I think :p
 :(
 ooooh
 I like this theme
 Smallest I think is Yorkshire Terrier, if you go by the smallest recorded of the species.  Taking QI as a source ;)
 Alex: I meant they /look/ like it
 because of their sheer size difference
 ah here we go
 http://localhostr.com/files/0f5ca2/DestroyTwitter.png
 I know, I just think it is interesting how small the smallest is, it was only a few inches lengthways :p

 "Sylvia, a matchbox-size Yorkshire Terrier owned by Arthur Marples of Blackburn, England, was the smallest dog in recorded history. The dog died in 1945 when she was almost two years old, at which point she stood 2.5 inches tall at the shoulder, measured 3.5 inches from nose tip to tail, and weighed 4 ounces."
 Pretty small ;)
 sounds like Zoey (the chihuahua) haha
 I've seen that seven legged spider before, seems he grew a new leg at one point (looks like he lost it again after the payment in lieu of artwork)
 haha yea zardoz
 hey Ed
 Hey.
 Been awhile since I've been able to type this: Morning (Eevning) Ed
 double e
 aww man
 no OS X on the tablet supposedly
 ;-;
 Can some people go to the #hosting?
 lol
 I went and I'm back
 Morning ZARDOZ :P
 hello
 Hello Coolbut13 
 one of my website got banned for phishing but all i made it for is to see if it works wont going to use it
 That doesn't matter to us
 As far as we're concerned, having it shows too much interest
 but could anything happen?
 Bottom-line, if you have a phishing site it gets suspended, no exceptions
 If you're looking for one, you might as well give up now
 We also report it to the ISP
 In your case Sky
 sky?
 Your internet provider
 BSkyB Ltd If you want the full company name
 ok
 lol
 Not a laughing matter, they terminate accounts and will possibly pass on your details to local law authorities
 We have logs of you uploading the files, we log everything you use our service for.
 ok
 nobody actually typed anything in
 sooo
 doesn't matter
 It's intent.
 You should read what you sign up for with ISPs
 They reserve the right to terminate your account for any reason at any time
 idc they suspended it
 i was about to delete it 
 lol
 We're talking about Sky your ISP here Coolbut13 
 Internet Service Provider, budduy
 ok ok
 i kno
 the way you are connected to the interwebz
 bluh
 I imagine you're not the bill payer?
 any way going now
 nope
 if they terminate based on a breach of AUP, you still have to pay the money owed.
 Whoever is is not going to be pleased if it does lead to terminated service then, they'll have to pay to be reconnected at best.
 ok
 bye
 If you wake up Coolbut13 with a stiff neck and after dreaming about eating giant marshmellows... you've just eaten your pillows.
 Evening all. Seems I stumbled on at a very serious moment!
 :O
 Indeed.
 I think I should report it :)
 nn Dave
 Ed and Alex .. double trouble ;)
 You off to bed TheOracle ?
 we should D:<
 "<Dave>Evening all."
 Evening Dave!
 As in "good evening".... hello, etc.
 hihi dave
 hello!
 very professional, and Matrix scary
 How many monitors you guys have 4, 5 maybe 6
 2 haha
 2
 I happen to know Ed has 13 monitors .... He has a picture of me permanently displayed on screen number 9 ;)
 Some number between 2 and 4 depending on what I have plugged in
 I thought I was doing good with 3 (when I'm completely set up)
 1 plasma is just not enuf real estate
 It's not enough
 I currently have 3 coding screens open alone
 Hah ;)
 3 monitors, but only the 2 working now :(
 Really want to get the 3rd back
 I had 30 windows open the other day on this thing and things got balled up
 I'm on 2 most times at uni, laptop + monitor
 If I had the money and the space I'd be running 7 ;)
 LOL
 Plus the laptop's
 *lol
 I have enough ports for it with various machines
 ah laptop + monitor for me aswell Alex
 2 macs, an IBM and 3 clone PC's
 My main desktop hasn't really had much use recently, but that's capable of running 4
 I can run two
 oh and the laptop very rarely used anymore
 Wouldn't mind having 8 displays though, 'course I'd set them all up with synergy
 So only one keyboard/mouse ;)
 But seriously, I'd have to have a room just for them if I wanted that
 And for some reason student houses tend not to give you a computer room as well as a bedroom
 Go figure
 I used to use the garage as my office
 botted the car out
 booted*
 Not sure I'd want to do that, garage doors aren't really that secure usually :p
 But it would mean less money spent on cooling ;)
 they are if you're an electronics engineer
 That so?  I will have to get to know my housemate for next year better then
 within 25 feet of the garage and you've tripped the sensors which activate the 4 cameras
 He's doing a PhD in electronic engineering
 hey peeps
 Something to do with nanotechnology
 watcha ppl talking about here?
 everything and almost anything
 loool
 (Mibbit@Zymic-343921D7.bb.sky.com)
 lol
 i have a relly crap website how i delete the website or my acc?
 wow nice try
 fail
 sky is a famous thing i england
 ?
 like virgin
 ily the best way is to just delete the files from the hosted account
 %py eval
 TheOracle: eval(expression[, globals[, locals]]) The arguments are a string and optional globals and locals.
 Bigger than virgin in the realm of TV
 (Mibbit@Zymic-343921D7.bb.sky.com) = coolbut13
 trying to trick us into just deleting your account and forgetting? lol
 i deok
 ok*
 nope
 i relly do have a shit website
 i got a accoutn called coolbut12
 ...
 ohwow
 and i uploaded a website i made with dreamweaver
 the beauty of this ily is that even if the site becomes a nightmare you can jus start over not making the same mistakes
 ily - give up
 We know who you are
 lol
 We're not going to help you
 >.>
 look wait one sec
 ah the cats out of the bag
 rand = random.random()
 whoops, that was meant for the file >.<

 http://xtreme-community.webs.com/
 whoops, that was meant for the file >.<       (what we talking about having not enuf monitors)

 Zardoz: actually I forgot to click the file's window before typing
 oh the phisher ok

 it made a zymic account
 without your consent
 and then uploaded itself?
 i didnt make the websites

 :P
 <Coolbut13> one of my website got banned for phishing but all i made it for is to see if it works wont going to use it
 yh cus he gave it to me
 you should read before you sign up for zymic, or anything in general
 Ily, for your information the law does not provide for ignorance of the law
 well i dint 
 lol
 thats a great excuse
 thnxs

 Word of advice here, if you want to learn something... learn from a decent book.  Not from random people on the Internet.
 best at ict in my year :)
 Certainly not people with as little sense as 4chan users
 i wont i never going to hack ever !
 Alex is one of those random people
 You got lucky, I learned a lot of crap when I got started :p
 lolzor
 I'm off for a bit
 im the best at computers in my year/grade 
 Well that's lovely :)
 i kno 
 was you?
 I might have been...
 :D
 knowledge comes with the consequence of responsibility ily
 Heh, setting the bar a bit low there :p
 but instead of learning stuff on the pc sometimes i go on css >><
 lol
 I bet you use windows :x
 yeh yeh
 and it appears with your knowledge by your own admission you have understanding
 windows xp fat but sexi

 type 1 for xp 2 for linux 3 for macs
 ily can I ask, If this get's back to your parents how would they resolve this illegalness you have created
 donno
 beat me ya knoo
  ? <ily> type 1 for xp 2 for linux 3 for macs
 voting
 which one is better
 Understandable.
 1
 3/2/1.
 6.
 7
 Very original DarkKrai.
 take a moment and think for If your son did something illegal and it was about to cost some monies and time how would you resolve it, you have an analytical mind
 He's only 7 years of age :-P
 haha
 Yeah, 7 year olds installing linux, reformatiting computers, doing some web design, going on /b/ and DDOSing people
 why would it even cost monehs all u gotta do is right click on a page and press source
 infact i didnt do it right
 lol
 DDoS'ing people eh DarkKrai?
 only on raids
 not zymics :P
 DarkKrai, like you know how. ;-).
 its not that hard
 :x
 haha
 bbl
 You mean we have to have you back TheOracle?
 ily, if your parents get involved in your illegalness by any manner it will cost them thru their time and efforts to resolve this issue
 all i did was right click then source and copy n paste it :D
 so technically i would get done for copy right :S
 That's called stealing.
 its the fact that you used it
 the fact its a phisher
 no matter how you got it
 its not a copyright issue
 DarkKrai!
 that is irregardless of the point the point is that you have created something that is a very malicious tool used for illegal activity
 <!--Copyright 2009 Andrew Christensen for use on http://zymic.com/-->
 tool?
 right click --> view source
 :D
 an phishing website
 why is it called phishing may i ask
 ?
 lool
 Oh ily is Coolbut13
 yeah lol
 :-P
 ow i clicked my fingers
 ily - try googling 'phishing' and you might learn something.
 itee
 !google phishing
 www.google.com/search?q=phishing
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing An example of a phishing e-mail, disguised as an official e-mail from a ( fictional) bank. The sender is attempting to trick the recipient into revealing 
 is it like fishing :D
 you are knowledgeable on hoew to research computing, you are knowledgeable enough in researching to know where to locate such information
 In the field of computer security, phishing is the criminally fraudulent process of attempting to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit card details.
 atm im trying to learn about c+++
 c++ lol
 Next person says LOL will get the EdRulesTreatmant.
 LOL

 There needs to be an age limit on the internet.
 So predictable :-P.

 You're not funny DarkKrai :/
 it's rough trying to instill the consciousness of one who has none, wonder how GOD figured it out
 Brandon, when did I attempt to be funny?
 its Frank
 D:
 :(
 Franks Back, Yea
 no :(
 DarkKrai, the last thing I want to do is hurt you. But it's still on the list Sighs...
 something like what has happened here has definitely re-inforced my belief that if I had children, I'd be childless and sitting in prison
 lol
 what do you mean Brandon?
 Why be difficult, when with a bit of effort, you can be impossible? >.< fgt.
 i like that one
 you guys never cease to amaze me with the abbreviations
 if it wasn't for the quick search, I'd not know what hap'ns here sometimes
 lol
 I've learned alot (sometimes I wish I had'nt)    hahahahaha thx Brandon
 :-P.
 I hope I'm an abuser in that case, hahahahaha
 I wasn't saying at you. I was quoting it. Now I have every intention that to be aimed at you :-P.
 I gathered that but I figured I'd throw that one in

 hellooooo zymic!
 how do i edit the file php.ini?
 ?
 I'm afraid you can't
 What do you want to do with it?
 raise the limit of memory
 We'd never allow that - with the number of users we have we are occasionally stretched at peak times
 The limit is there to prevent a single user using too much
 ok...so how can i use gallery2 with drupal?
 Your PHP is configured to limit the memory to 16M (memory_limit parameter in php.ini). You must raise this limit to at least 24M for proper embedded Gallery2 operation.
 this is the error
 the answer si you dont
 if you need 24mb to run Gallery2, and zymic is limited to 16mb, then you cant
 The log for this has just reached 1MB
 Just thought you all wanted to know...
 I'm off for the day
 Yummm sausage and egg batch... gotta love Fridays

 Ben did you hear that kevin got a MSN virus from a WinUp copy?
 nope I only got home today
 well he did lol
 heh how is that possible unless someone infected the file then he download it or w/e
 ionno
 his virus scanner found an infection in a winup file
 False positive perhaps?
 and that was after andrew-c told him he was spreading a virus on MSN
 dunno
 Could be another virus infecting the executable
 heh well there is nothing in the code that downloads a virus or anything, ask Andrew I send him the code (Get him to look).
 true Ed
 Can always checksum it

 Yeh ty, Ill take a look later i don't have a copy of winup with me.

 hello zymic!
 Dang I have to use Tables :(
 y
 you don't /have/ to
 Because I dont know other ways
 so idk
 And I need to make a form and I use tables to do that
 T_T
 someone /kill jotta
 nvm dont
 Cr`eme: you could always inspect how existing CSS forms are structured
 Yeah
 I could use labels right?
 s/could/should/
 :P ok
 Man for some reason the server that one of my shells is on isnt connecting to internet so I cant use lynx :O

 Cr`eme: ping a domain, ping an IP address, do they both respond?
 I will try 
 I mean there website eont even work
 even localhost
 :O
 But for some reason irc is working
 because I am using it

 HOMG 
 Why would the owner of KTTNs Give me an Invite When the registration is closed :O?
 But atleast I got one:P
 he probably made a mistake
 IDK
 He sent me a reply and said keep it till it is open
 -_-
 mwhaha :D
 wdfuk is KTTN
 It is a private website with invites
 like dznr
 and idzr
 ic
 and itiz
 But no one can get a dznr unless you know the maker idzr is hard to get and kttns is ok itiz.in is easy but they are in beta atm
 *toing ?
 mwhahah :D
 Dolleh: D<
 what? :D
 STOP LAUGHING o<
 why are they s hard to get accounts on
 its not like its difficult to make a script to do that
 :P
 You need an invitation code
 and more
 wow
 but the scripts are so easy to make
 and require like 0 effort
 True
 you just make a script like gfdggsg.php
 which takes ?code=whatever
 mwhahah :D
 and then use the RewriteMod
 or wahtever it is in apache
 But I guess it has to do with its famousness or popularity
 to make the url http://yoursite/code
 Yup
 That is how it is
 no shit..
 :O
 Internet explorer needs to get better if they want to get rich. Because it sucks
 :D
 really, because I thought IE was free
 I think the makers of FireFox probably has more money then the maker of internet explorer
 But again IDK
 i herd microshit arent allowed to bind ie8 to windows os'
 or sum bull
 :P
 Ok I am going to be away too bye
 i give it 10 mins before has back
 no it's not free
 onizuka, internet explorer is
 windows isn't
 (legally anyway ;))
 Pie`: Microsoft have been forced to provide a browser ballot screen in the EU on load
 Which gives users a choice of several browsers
 focus on bing map
 bing is bullshit
 ^
 Google ftw
 so is yahoo
 Which is more significant than not being allowed to bind it to the OS, it means that and the fact that there is no default browser out of the box
 In the EU
 Other regions likely unaffected
 DarkKrai: bing is affiliated with Yahoo! just so you know ;)
 It either will, or already does provide the backend for Yahoo!'s search
 i registered with bing map develop yesterday

 Anyone here used ajax and can answer a quick question?
 When you make a server request, does it send the cookie values?
 i.e, with PHP, do you have access to $_SESSION?
 i dont think so, but you could send the users ip over in the request
 then use php to get the session vars
 or something
 :L
 No thank you...
 And you can't get session vars without the session cookie
 i knwo you can use cookie's in js
 but not $_SESSION's
 except by storing them in hard copy, and thats messy
 why would you want to use the $_SESSION var from js ?
 what would be the purpose
 im sure there would be an easier way
 To ensure that a logged in user is accessing the script
 And not just a complete randomer
 I'm about to write something to access my db
 I'd rather not effectively give access to everyone
 I'll ask later when the right people are on
 i think you can use the $_SESSION var in php but i dont think you can read the values form js
 I'm off for now
 I don't want to read from js
 but on the http request you could check fi the user is logged in in the php script
 I just want the page the ajax is accessing to have it
 oh yeah you can do that

 Hey Tim
 Hello
 timmie is back :D
 I got a question how do you make your text look like it is embeded?
 HE IS :O
 Do you mean Embossed ?
 Yeah
 :P
 like in that page above?
 Yes
 text-shadow: 0px 1px #dcdcdc;
 :)
 :D Thanks
 text-shadow: 0px 1px #dcdcdc;
 Opps
 was going to name the params
 hang on
 Ok
 text-shadow: Y X COLOUR;
 there is also a way to add a blur
 css3 ?
 but blurs lead to slower rendering times
 Yep
 Oh ok
 Same with the Border Radius for curved corners without images
 atm there prefixed with -moz- for firefox and -webkit- for webkit browsers
 :)
 Cool
 How did you make the boxes be curved too? Becuase I used to use images but you dont
 -webkit-border-radius: 10px;
 -moz-border-radius: 10px;
 Set both
 use css or javascript
 :D
 so it works in FireFox or WebKit browsers
 Ok
 Thank You
 ohai, Tim is here :D

 Nice, Tim.
 so going to adapt this to a new personal site
 :d
 nothing's happening?
 Tim, it seems odd to refer to one by the corporation and the other by the rendering engine on your example page :p.  Surely it would be better to say WebKit, Gecko, KHTML (partial) and Presto in Opera 10 I think
 When I hover over YummyCocoa it completly disappears
 That's about it
 it was simply to aid the understanding of tag prefixes Alex
 Robert then thats a bug lol
 [22:04:05] <Averna> Aff takes molotov cocktails and inserts into anus

 ZYmics, I'd like to introduce my older Brother - Bad_Monkey
 FREE ADVICE!  School's For Learning, Education Is For Life
 :P
 http://dznr.org/iej5
 Maybe I'll come back later
 Hey Alex
 Tim, there/their mistake in the first paragraph ;)
 Thought I should mention this if it's important
 Got past my english Tutor alex
 Oh dear
 Don't want to step on any toes, figured I'd let the long lived Zymic's in on who he is (not that it means anything - most likely
 I would rephrase the last sentence of the first paragraph as well
 Alex it got an A
 :P
 Its fine
 Today is a good day in #zymic.
 All is well, as Cr`eme is not here
 hOORAY!
 *hOORAY!
 D:
 lool
 Dolleh kilt him the other day
 what dont you like about him?
 yup :D
 killed even
 Tim, heh, fair enough I guess.  I still think they should have pointed these things out themselves though ;)
 It's their job
 Yes
 http://dznr.org/fw2x is one on king lear
 That was a B
 Yes, they one goes a bit wrong within three words ;)
 :P
 Or one word of the title since it should ideally be British English
 simpley
 simply
 Sush
 *Simply,
 DarkKrai: actually, the word is mid-sentence, a capital would be a mistake ;)
 D:
 oops :(
 I love the way people always go straight for whats wrong
 pesimists
 Me? :(
 To be fair, it's hard to get to what's right within one paragraph
 And I wasn't planning on reading more ;)
 I got burned for this before, I got some ridiculously low mark back for my English in year 9
 you should have bust him up
 Mine and a few others for our school
 This got A's and B's at A2 so it cant be that bad
 :P
 Got sent back for remarking about four times, then the teacher went to our local paper with it :p
 The marking for spelling on that was ridiculously arbitrary
 I got 1/4 for the spelling marks, I'd made one noted "its" vs "it's" slip
 And other people got full marks when they've got stuff like "tursda" instead of "thursday"
 looooool
 that's funny Alex 
 other people got full marks when they've got stuff like "tursda" instead of "thursday"
 heh
 On the spelling segment of the marks, yeah, I found it fairly ridiculous
 checking my USB to see if there is a newer version of that Totalitarian Essay
 nope
 Anyways, at least if I'm going to get screwed over for marks at any point, I'd rather it was in year 9 or GCSE when the results don't really matter
 If it happens now, it's much worse :p
 Urgh the more I read of that essay the more I wish to change
 I think the final copy is on my schools system
 Alex, GCSE's do count...
 never to be seen again lol
 Mufia
 you means SATS i guess...
 not when you have A levels or degree's
 ofc not when
 GCSE's are never used for employment
 but to get there...
 You need  A*-C
 And only five of those
 Which is trivial
 Lol my sixth form was 7
 all my grades where C-A*
 Well, yeah, it varies depending on what exactly you want to do
 Alex, in the school i went to i only done 3 GCSEs
 All mine were B+, hah ;)
 Alex this was to get into sixth form
 way before course choices
 ;)
 Well, you could have gone to a different sixth form or further education college
 Depending on availability
 I needed a few A or above GCSEs for some things
 was because i got kicked out of my original school, so ad to go centre
 had*
 I got one B... shamefully embarrassing ordeal it was :p
 lalala
 I got straight C's bar one A
 the A was English
 :P
 You probably win GCSE then, Dave :p
 I got three
 So I guess, by that comment, that you won A-level?
 I can't quite remember what you got...
 U's ;-)
 Excited Ben?
 Nope not really lol, im going into hospital 3 days before which means i can't go get drunk at night (N)
 or before i go and get them
 Dave
 did you see my cider fulled Yann?
 Fueled *
 Hey Ed
 Heya.
 Same day im going to this cadet things to do a BTEC awardy thingy which is another 4 GCSE's
 I've watched, but without sound, Tim!
 oh noes :O
 Will get some headphones soon...
 Dolleh, YOU LIVE IN THE COLDS OF SWEDEN 
 LUCKY..
 DOES SHE REALLY?!
 :P
 cold weather sucks
 Dave: shush, physics was awesome :p
 ^ ;-)
 Coursework especially, the last one where you could take any topic you wanted and just research and talk about it.
 I'm sure it was, but I'm glad I chose Chemistry over it and always will be :)
 Bit hard to get into but very interesting
 My Uncle lives in Netherlands and when he came to america during the summer he loved the heat when I was burning
 :P
 Chemistry wasn't bad, but it wasn't anywhere near as much fun :p
 From what I heard, it was at our school
 Head of Chem was the best ever, he was practically an institution.
 :P

 Huh?

 Yes it is 
 Cr"eme VA Norfork?
 pretty decent in MadCity, lil muggy about low 80's
 Its been raining on/off here

 got a good breeze up though
 It was pouring and pretty windy a bit ago

 hehe
 yes Brandon
 What did you want?
 How do I get the Linkinus 2.0 to identify for me on logon
 Brandon DarkKrai wants you to make him a layout, please tell him yes or no so he will stop annoying me kthxbye
 No.
 way to give away the staff room again outlet ;P
 Not like you can get in :-P
 Who uses Gobby 
 ?
 lol its just the title so
 i'm in the super old staff channel lol
 heh not completely. Besides I think most people know it anyway
 Heh, reminds me of one of the OSX IRC apps, that had a fun auto-ident system
 it uses a key iirc
 only alex ed and jack in it lol
 xD :P
 Which tried to ident twice causing the server to provide a message ignored message to all opers
 oh also Brandon I haven't been abl to figure out how to join rooms with keywords
 :O>-<
 I got a lot of OSX people's nickserv passwords, I did warn them about it though :p
 Easy..
 http://grabup.crownstyles.com/ba8b15dd202677f1f0c9b91410d4da55.png < When you double click the channel.. You see "Key" :p
 :p Alex hacking
 That'd be more like accidental phishing
 It's hardly hacking when it happens without my intervention
 ;p
 passive phishing if you will
 Anyways, there was some conf setting where it would try to indent twice, we worked out what it was
 When coding the python bots in here, did they use a lib for irc interaction?
 or just interact directly
 ?
 okay I tried that and it said "You need to be operator on #..."
 :O>-<
 god damnit
 gosh darnit
 kwill da wabbit
 Yeah, I would assume that's for setting the channel key, Brandon.  Changing mode +k
 ^ as I figured
 Ops.. Yes xD
 and for some reason /join #... <pass> doesn't work
 Yeah, well, it's fashionable to break normal behavior apparently :p
 Ed would know best
 not when it interferes with functionality
 *cough* kubuntu's kdesudo among other things
 damn hipster programmers
 irc.freenode.net 
 is really crowded :O>-<
 :/
 Really.
 you young ones never cease to amaze me
 :P
 I didn't say it was a good idea, I said it was fashionable ;)
 lol
 Do tell, Cr`eme. Is EFNet crowded aswell?
 lol
 :P
 should be gliend for advertising other networks
 checj DALnet while you're at it
 You wouldn't get away with it as a software engineer ;)
 I said it was crowded
 you also provided a link, as a subtle hint ;)
 At least, not a real one
 :/
 Deal with it then
 i'm an intern software engineer \o/
 A chartered software engineer, not someone who just has the title given to them by their job
 Because the job title's worth nothing :p
 SP, nice.  Good stepping stone to getting the actual CEng ;)
 yeah, working with Mark
 startup company in silicon valley
 You have a similar system to us I believe, get it from the IEEE in the US after being peer reviewed by a group of existing CEngs
 not all "whosaith's" know things
 the CEO is a real awesome guy
 Getting an internship quite early as well, aren't you 17 or something?
 Brb Chips
 You mean we have to have you back Cr`eme?
 :P
 outlet: http://grabup.crownstyles.com/198132b65046dfe289d6d22a94f8c0ca.png
 oh that's good, that young
 Alex, yup 17
 Brandon I'm pretty sure thats for Server Passwords
 not NickServ
 lol
 Hard to get /decent/ work at that age without some sort of family connection :p
 No..
 I actually got offered internships at two other places local, because my dad knows people
 But I'd be doing bs work there
 It says nickserv top-right
 I actually get to program etc with this one
 well im gonna head out for a bit ill check it out later
 My bad.
 Ffs/1 aFfs :(
 keep the nose to the grindstone, SP
 yup, expanding atm, learning a bit of python
 I give up =(
 Back
 Cr`eme type /quit  it's not working for me :/
 Nah it is ok
 I am not stupid
 :/
 could have fooled me
 Planning on a computer science major or similar, SP?
 fooled me
 probably alex
 either that, or just engineering
 Good, because then like me you can scoff at these ad-hoc programmers ;)
 And people who've got a maths degree but think they're as good as us :p
 haha
 I get dumber everyday, beat that with a stick
 A fair few companies do do it that way, take in maths graduates then train them, but it still comes off a bit lacking in terms of rigour
 people in here and the hosting support lower my IQ
 Largely because of their introduction to programming, my brother for example
 that's good, humbleness
 i've been programming going on 6 years now
 albeit the beginnign was html etc
 He's done a maths degree at cambridge, you'd think they'd teach things properly if anyone does :p
 But the module they have they just give them a set of problems and say "go learn C and do it"
 ha
 No teaching at all, means a lot of nastiness in the code
 Especially starting with C
 fuck c, give them lisp and go crazy
 :p
 Lisp is actually quite easy to teach in :p
 it's a very beautiful language too
 A whole load of universities start with Scheme which is a lisp derivative
 Including mine :p
 Because there's almost no syntax at all
 yeah
 Means they don't have to teach the language, just concepts
 Alex, do you know how to add a user in a shell?
 man useradd
 Ok
 :P
 lol
 you will get all of your answers if you just put 5sec into googling man
 Nope google kept on saying crap abbout apropos useradd
 and that didnt help at all
 he strip the search out of his stuff
 because it kept on saying to do that 
 :O
 http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/howto-write-shell-script-to-add-user.html
 the first result.
 SP: I'm not sure I consider it that beautiful
 Once it gets complex
 It's pretty damn nasty :p
 i like how it looks :p
 yeah
 just started python
 TheOracle, did you use a prebuilt irc lib for pydelphi
 yes
 irclib?
 doesn't have a name, I got it off Freenode
 ic
 i'm using irclib atm, not a lot of documentation to go with it
 yeh
 can you upload the lib your using somewhere so i can look at it TheOracle
 I would but I'm kinda busy atm
 Thing I didn't like about Scheme, was that it was a fairly interpreted language
 ah np, if you get a chance gimme a highlight
 But the error messages it provided were so bloody useless
 heh
 You had to debug by logical step-through in every case, there was no other way :p
 ouch
 The functional paradigm is interesting though
 It's just not my cup of tea really :p
 some space shuttle was run off lisp, and it ran into an issue in space
 because lisp jsut drops intoa  debug menu the astronauts were able to fix it
 Interesting, it's usually FORTRAN or something for those projects.
 off to bed
 cya guys
 I think there's a story about an unmanned shuttle that crashed because the syntax in that is bad enough that misplacing "," with "." meant a line which should have been a loop declaration
 Instead declared a variable
 rofl
 So it didn't loop the block
 http://programming.ccp14.ac.uk/fortran-resources/~cgp/prof77/node2.html there we go
 Under "Guidelines" it has the story :p

 Just been to my sister's crash site, pretty somber experience, the same place my sister crashed there were flowers and evidence of at least two cars going in there.
 Oh dear.. bit of a hot spot then? Hope they're going to do something about it..

 What should be changed
 or added
 etc
 Sounds fine to me. If you want something more, I'd add some strings in the background.
 But, for its length, I don't think it needs that much.
 its a pain
 It needs something else
 ya know Tim right before the real first break, it sounds jus a lil out of key when you pronounce, i think that pronounce should be not quite as heavy in tone bit a lil feathery right there
 with the heavy ponce but a lil feathery (lighter mixed in with to relieve the lil off key sound
 that happens a jus about 5/8 of the way thru
 it's right there that it jus kinda throws the mood
 I not musically talented so I don't know what the c,d or f key sounds like but it jus sounds out of key right there on that heavy deep tone
 dANG
 I am going to switch computers
 the rest jus sounds so beautiful but that one spot
 It's like a sour waver
 Cr`eme get out

 Ben, for you anything

 thats true zardoz... but more lame than normal? lol
 lol ya it does  :P need to get a new image but that works for now lol
 that chick kinda looks like a man lol
 XD
 looks okay, what happens when you click on a date (htere not enough room for data in the sq.'s
 if you look closely it appears she has suspenders
 is that actual size KD
 kevin is it?
 was gona make it so that if theres something on the date it turns a different shade
 then you hover over it and it tells you more
 iono zardoz :P havent decided lol
 okay
 i guess i could get rid of the bar on the left for the schedule page
 and make the calender full size
 probably would be best
 yeah, cuz then there is a bit of room for a brief mention of Event
 then when one hovers it expands or whatever
 kk
 makes sense to me :D lol

 I worked out why the markov chain was producing utter nonsense :D
 instead of some degree of intelligence
 (Although there is no intelligence behind it)
 this better size wise? www.sharpielovers.com/images/grabs/Q33A5.png
 Let me guess Pie`, you let it loose in an evironment where there was no real intelligent structure of sentences that it could learn from
 No :b
 I was just picking random words form random lines in random places
 sup all
 whereas if you pick say 2 or 3 words from what a user has recently said, and then search the message back for that string
 and then link what was after what the previous user said
 to another, sa 2 - 3 words from that new found strnig
 and just do that till you get a desired length
 you should have a decent string of words
 Good Kevin, need to chk Wensday (typo)
 oops lol

 I am about to flip at this IRC 
 why Jacob?
 Why?
 some wannabe has set up a java version and doesn't know what he is doing
 For boostcruising.com
 O great
 end of my business
 I'm not allowed on PayPal for 2 years
 I received upto 3300 USD within a year, and I'm 16
 Nice job 
 min. requirement is 18
 Anyways, enough of your problems
 time to get mom and pops to open the account
 bbl
 Having a break Tim? Don't forget your kit kat
 or is this a case of they don't know about your internet activities
 Jack, it's just bullshit. I've been using PayPal for at least 3 years, and once I'm making a shitload of money, they suspend me
 J@ck won't care about your issues
 they take your money too?
 I can still receive money and withdraw
 I just can't pay my $150/mo hosting :(
 get a new account ?
 That was my plan, until the dick on the phone told me that my details have been logged in case I make a new account
 get a new account and lie about your age..
 Juw, what was the reason they banned you like, suspision of money laundering ?
 Juw, lie about allyour details
 get a new back
 great learning experience for the younrg entreprenuer, reading the fine print of contracts
 fake id
 :b
 Juw, will your company collapse now?
 Pie`, PayPal has this shitty $3300 limit
 once you receive more within 12 months, they block the account and ask for copy of ID cards and such
 hello
 but they didn't want to unblock me due to age
 i`ve got some question
 shoulda lied
 Pie`, the point is that I registered on PayPal a long time ago, and they clearly didn't give a shit about age at that time :)
 how did they find out ?
 he sent his id?
 !seen TheOracle
 TheOracle is on the channel right now (as pyDelphi) ! 
 dam I need him and outlet =[
 ha
 Pie`, I could make up a fake account and fake ID
 but I just don't know if they're somehow linked with my gov
 to check everything
 You need to verify it to use it
 yeah, they're Saudi's - there linked to every gov't
 they're*
 paypal is owned by arabs? D
 D:
 i thought it was some US job
 so did I
 didn't know that Pie`?
 nope
 you do now
 heh
 their charter to conduct business in the US is granted by the District of Columbia (not part of the US - that's the first clue)
 I don't really understand how paypal could do this to me lulz
 i've gotten them like thousands of euros
 because they hate you
 Simple as that
 The dick on the phone did sound like a hater yeah
 you volunteered for it by entering into a contract with them willfully of your own accord
 but the woman yesterday was really friendly
 oh and no, when I signed up for PayPal they just didn't care.
 jus remember that if it sounds to good to be true it's probably not
 I sent my ID at least 5 times in the past years and they've never moaned about it
 wtf
 yet my account details clearly state "May 3, 1993"
 my text is writing back wards in the URL bar
 So I really don't understand why they're cutting me off right now, and not at the time I registered.
 the world of business, fun crap isn't it
 Dude, COPPA
 You shouldn't even be on the net at your age
 underage B&
 lolol 
 They can be shut down if they are dealing with minors
 Lol message from andy "which one of you funny cunts put my msn addy on messenger freak?" xD who was it?
 Ha
 Jacob, coppa is some U.S law, right?
 "got random gays adding me asking me to go on cam" haha
 COPPA is everywhere
 hahaha
 I don't think so
 Yes Juw 
 http://www.coppa.org/coppa.htm
 I guess my own government clearly ignores that
 (1) CHILD.The term "child" means an individual under the age of 13.
 Hmm, I am sure that has been upp'd
 I doubt about it Jacob
 Juw: 5 minutes ago, you told me COPPA doesn't apply to you, now your going to argue again?
 13 is when you become a 'teen' and are no longer a child
 so a child would be under the 'teen' years
 Anyone know what is up is Brandons server being down ?
 Ben: When is Brandon's servetr up any more?
 Pie`: We had a meeting about this the other day
 you're a child until you reach the legal age of adulthood
 nothing to do with law
 Jacob, I told you that because my government clearly doesn't listen to the COPPA
 I need it up Jacob :(  Might move the site to mine or andrews zymic acc instead.
 Even though it states 13; I am sure they can govern it until they are 18
 But if the COPPA states under the age of 13, they do.
 My government has something close to PayPal, and you're not allowed to use it under the age of 13.
 Ben: I didn't even know it got back up
 legal is a ghost, an apparition smoke and mirrors it has no substance unlike the law which is immutable
 I am considering taking up smoking
 Why was it down ?
 hasn't worked for a while
 Then Jacob, you are very stupid.
 Because he didn't pay bill or somrthing to do with Arania
 I get more lunch breaks if I smoke. :(
 ffs =[
 haha
 OH DAMNIT
 I had 3 open chargeback cases and PayPal refunded all the money to those people now
 devo
 I didn't even have the time to submit my own story
 Your business skills suck
 Juw: How did you mnake money online aways? Dancing naked for old men?
 Jacob, actually I have a big community, ask Pie`.
 some go to college others go to the school of hard knocks
 lol Jacob 
 Jacob, he does
 he owns a website runelocus.com or something
 learn from this Juw
 Pie` is probs one of your customers
 not customer, user
 and ex, if you please.
 :O
 now ur getting the hang of it Pie`
 ZARDOZ, ? D:
 Juw: What is your profit per annum?
 lol, silence...
 Jacob, ads bring around 2k euro per month, additional payment things on my site bring around 1k
 Yea, your defs pulling your dick
 Juw: Your business number?
 I don't need one :)
 :S
 tax invasion
 e*
 evasion *
 thanks ZARDOZ 
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_avoidance_and_tax_evasion
 Not really Jacob (:
 Juw, kinda is
 if you had a charter to conduct biz then they could not have donee this to you
 Because you're earning a good 2k euro from adverts
 which is your income
 which should be taxed
 if it was purely donations, then iirc you dont get taxed on donations
 Pie`, which is why I pay tax on the end of the year, just like any other person over here?
 Pie`: technically, they do tax you for them
 Unless your a church or some shit like that
 Juw, you'd need a buisness number to pay tax..
 personal income not coroporate income, big diff
 corporate*
 Mufia, doesn't look like it
 Hold on Juw. What's your age again?
 16
 so you wouldn't even have one year of legal knowledge under your belt
 thought we almost had a child labor act thing 
 As compared to a few others in here that have that knowldge
 Mufia, I simply have to register my income and send the money to the tax bankaccount
 Well, that's how we do in NL
 how long has your site been going?
 past 2 years now isnt it?
 or nearly 2 yaers
 nearly 2 years
 oh, so you would have done this before?
 would have done what?
 paid tax..
 proved your yearly income
 I've always been paying tax my friend
 I actually like it
 I tap 30% of my income to an additional bank account with extra credit
 Juw: Now I know your lying
 if you have _ALWAYS_ been paying tax then the dutch government sux :/
 How can you lie giving away 15% of your money?
 silly notion, like paying tax
 Pie`, by always I mean the time I had RL.
 Jacob, now I know that you don't understand our system.
 Juw, you're lieing about enjoying paying tax
 Juw: To say your like paying tax is like saying you love to have a dog chew your left testicle off
 you need to get chartered or non-profited

 BSN, is that Bullshitnotes

 Thank you Pie`
 http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http://www.burgerservicenummer.nl/&hl=en&langpair=auto|en&tbb=1&ie=ISO-8859-1
 Juw, what is the last month you have to report your income?
 Mufia, what?
 'last month'?
 <Mufia> Juw, what is the last month you have to report your income?
 yes last month.
 Jack
 ffs
 Jacob
 BSN = CSN
 About this site 
 The citizen service number (BSN)
 Pie`, we worked that one out.
 Mufia, don't ask me.
 They will tell me, I wont.
 You said you've paid tax previously
 there for, it should be common for you to know when the last month is
 Juw, what is you CSN ?
 your *
 it's clear you've never paid tax before, stop lieing.
 lying*
 &nbsp
 Mufia, my January was the last month we HAD to pay
 but that doesn't mean we DID
 Juw, what is your CSN ?
 wrong, March.
 Pie`, personal
 do your research.
 its not personal, according to ths site
 To me it is Pie`
 The advantage of the BSN is that you have this number on each window of the public can access. 
 Mufia, March? No way
 No later than March citizens have to report their income of the previous year.
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax_in_the_Netherlands
 "No later than March citizens have to report their income of the previous year. "
 indeed
 <Mufia> Juw, what is the last month you have to report your income?
 "i dont know"
 Mufia, the government will start the letters in January
 dont now say "indeed" like you knew. I'm sorry, but it's like the bullshit just flys out of your mouth. For that reason I'll stop speaking with you.
 and the not-funny commercials
 Mufia, if you wiki, read it the right way.
 hey DarkKrai
 hihi
 March is the last month Mufia
 January is the start, right after new years evening.
 "No later than March"
 makes it kinda obvious
 Juw> Mufia, don't ask me.
 <Juw> They will tell me, I wont.
 it's clear you did not know before.
 Anyways, you two are giving me a headache
 Indeed, they tell me when I have to pay
 Juw: Your a n00b/liar (take your pick) and Mufia, you just love burning people
 lol
 Why are we even talking about tax Jacob?
 heh, sorry :)
 Because your a n00b who needs shit exapolining
 explaining*
 why not o's? >.>'
 Jacob, did your girlfriend break up or something?
 Because it's amazing to see you trying to rage at the moment
 d0es it make y0u l00k c00ler?
 Nah. n00bs like yourself and Cr`eme shit me
 geesh what kinda convo is this? D: I cant leave for a few minutes 
 lol
 Dolleh, dutch tax shit
 Dolleh: You should cover your eyes
 you should know about this stuff
 Dolleh, Jacob and Mufia think they understand the tax system lulz
 ahw fuck the goverment
 or, talk to me in pm :D
 yeah, Juw take it to heart and learn what has happened here, you clearly need to protect your business ventures in an entreprenurial manner, research what it takes to protect your business actions in the world not just NL
 Either that or just quit the shit
 ZARDOZ, you understand that I'm not registered as a business, right?
 you are global
 To you I am, to my government I'm not.
 yes, and that's why you are now suffering this loss
 what loss?
 Dolleh: Add me on mesapce
 paypal
 Oh that's going to be alright ZARDOZ
 No worries :)
 jacob, dolleh is not on myspace

 shes on yourspace
 Oh noes

 hi
 Hello I have a query, can anyone help me ??
 ZARDOZ,     As Always, You Know The deal Oatmeal, Later Bro Will Leave This Up Till Then
 can anyone tell me how to modify the php.ini file , i.e. the safe_mode to off
 I'm afraid you can't tinytux
 We don't allow that
 okay Mad_MOnkey , I'll probably be crashing in about 15 min to get a couple of hours
 oh
 just passed 23 hrs
 cause i was making use of some php scripts, and i was told that , i will require the safe_mode to be off
 it was just a contact form
 A contact form requires safe mode off?
 I'm surprised
 yes, thats what i was told 
 lol what more is a contact form than mailing form contents
 Ah, you may require the mail() function
 yes
 we do provide that for a 1 off $10 fee
 it prevents spammers abusing our service
 ok
 I m just a learner, and was also interest to know , what is the difference between keeping safe_mode off or on
 Roder That Bro
 Why do you capitalise every word in your sentences? That has to be one of the top 5 annoying things on the internet.
 hahahaha
 safe_mode disables a few functions
 is it possible to make contact form without the mail() function
 It means it's far harder for people to break our server

 Is it ok to install Windows 7 on a drive that just have the folders "RECYCLER" and "System Volume Information" in it?
 hehe last time i did that, my hdd was fked and i had to send my laptop of for 2 weeks to be fixed :/
 Somebody obviously been on naughty sites..

 (11:02:51)<TheOracle>Is it ok to install Windows 7 on a drive that just have the folders "RECYCLER" and "System Volume Information" in it?
 Did you not format it first? :/
 I did but then windows put that shit on it :/
 Ha..
 Vista...
 XP actually Rob
 Nothing wrong with Vista, Robert.
 Get the linux installer to format it during the install
 OK, I stand corrected
 Linux installer? :(
 And I don't think it's that bad, but it does have some annoying habits
 UAC.
 Mr Linux guy now ;-). I'd kick his arse before he starts taking over your jobs Alex,Ed :-P.
 Where's Andrew when you need him...

 Woohoo.. Computers.

 Ed?
 Reverse engineer the binary, much like cracking a nag screen
 Ed they can try
 bbl gonna eat somat
 You mean we have to have you back TheOracle?
 but what I've done is have a C script that checks for the codesign identity apple gives each instance of an app when its bought
 plus the binaries are encrypted when on the users system
 and are sandboxed on device
 its a pain in the arse to hack them
 have you tried hacking it with Crackulous?
 thats what people use
 Well those people cannot be saved
 but, as you told me, you worked on the cracking process, so I would imagine you did something to prvent that
 somone will always crack your
 app
 yeah :(
  lol
 But the person that made such an app to crack others
 is a twat
 thats not, I cannot afford the app
 its
 Im a cunt and steal things

 Hello
 I'd like a selection of people to do something for me
 http://thatcode.com/ringing/submit.php
 The box by 1
 Type s
 Then select one of the entries
 Let me know if it works
 will do Robert.
 Thanks
 I've just got to find the right time for a timer
 Too fast and it doesn't work, too slow and you notice the lag
 it works
 but
 i dont like the box that appears
 The whole page has graphics issues
 none of the entries are highlighted, and its not much of a box
 I can fix that later
 but ti works
 Good
 s gives me 3 options
 Now I need someone with a slow computer
 There's only 6 in total atm
 wow.

 Robert, my friend has a slow computer i got him to do what you told me to do, and he syas the box came up right away
 And he was able to click it?
 Good, 250 ms is fine then
 100 ms was too quick
 !seen Andrew
 Andrew was last seen here 1 day, 18 hours, 17 minutes ago.

 btw if you put % in the box it takes like 5x longer than if yo had s
 and then all results are returned (Obv because % is a sql wildcard)

 Adam, there's a spelling mistake
 Where's that?

 Very minor
 But I did notice it
 Robert: eclipse says that \. is an invalid escape sequence
 Then it's not using regular regex

 "The 007 House"
 The creators of Bond aren't going to like that
 It's a nickname.
 They almost sued Peugot when the 1007 came out

 Yup, fixed length, 128 bit
 You can always check that with sBot...

 Isnt hashing!
 This sucks
 :P
 Ed, Alex fix it for Tim now please :D
 from what I can see
 I'm not touching that spaghetti language :P
 is the two updates are appending data to an MD context
 this is c ed

 hmm why am I coding, isn't that what Ed is for?
 Ben, been out every night. Working every day on my projects.
 I'm a person, not a machine Ben :(
 Oh ok :( and why do you have a sexy site and I dont ?
 Oh ok Ed sorry, my mistake =[
 Because anything I put my mind to, I complete to a very high standard.
 So if you imagined Megan Fox nude, you could photoshop her ?
 Probably. Yes.
 who would want to photoshop megan fox :L
 Sweet!
 A better question would be Ben.
 If I really wanted to fuck her, I probably could.
 hahaha xD
 Adam, i don't think so ;)
 Heh, suspended a site on the hosting that offered that service Ben, "your favourite celeb naked" :-p
 she wouldn't want to fuck any old geezer 
 I think I could.
 I'm not any old geezer, I'm quite cool.
 LMAO Ed, whats the url I'll unsuspend ;-)
 No idea, months ago :P
 The Jessica Alba one as an example was quite convincing.
 hehe you just don't want me to have Megan fox ><
 Btw.
 I broke my new car.
 Actually, I didn't. It broke it's self.
 It somehow managed to break a water pipe leading to the radiator. And I have to wait 4 days (now 2) for a replacement pipe to arrive.
 wow Adam, that garage sucks
 It's coming from Sweden.
 where i did my work experience, if a car needed a part it got ordered and came that day
 about an hour or so after the order was placed
 If you can order a part and get it the same day from Sweden, under warranty - I would be very impressed.
 im sure some garage would stock it
 Maybe. But I'm sure it would be a rare part.
 SUP NIGGAS!

 Yeh :/ have you spoken to James/Tim/Steven about it ?
 Well the first two are retards

 I'm calling it a day, c u's after a bit
 I'm annoyed by the amount of notifications I get everytime I come on
 Does sBot give you any?
 He should give you news
 Just a news headline which is fine
 But shouldn't give you the hosting one
 As you're a helper
 Nope, which is a very good thing you have 
 Sort Steve out ;)
 its annoyigng that steve does that
 I do need to write a messages plugin
 even when you know already -_-
 And just replace him
 Good move !
 Talk to Outlet, he excluded me from it somehow
 Well once you encompass all his functionality into sBot, he becomes obsolete 
 So there won't be any problem
 I'm worried outlet won't take that very well...
 you could get steve to have an option like, !notice off so he wont notice you on join D:
 Robert, I think you could let Alex/Ed break the news to him and it would all be fine ;)
 It's not like he can't be kept in other channels anyway

 Oooh nice, you using shoutcast ?
 yup
 Pretty cool :)
 Hey Ben. Sorry, was working on a design
 thanks =]
 Ahh ok, any previews for your favourite Ben ? ;-)
 Soon. The size of the file is currently 13mb
 Wow
 pretty big design then ?
 hmm can't decide if i should use a timer or a do until loop :/
 No the background itself is about 5mb
 heya peeps..., does anyone know if with a payment via paypal f_open in php is yet supported?
 Until loop = fun
 It's not
 We don't allow any outside connections I'm afraid
 haha yeh sazzad, wow 5mb background!! Custom made or image ?
 Kinda. Combination of 5 images, which I spent about 2 hours on
 5mB? That's huge...
 Yup
 It's a PNG 32 file
 Yeay shrunk the entire design down to 3mb
 Here Ben : http://www.files.jorsek.com/files/Concept_sz2_flat.png
 The header image is a place holder.
 I don't like the content area
 wow thats nice
 Love the background and header
 I hate hospitals =[
 Hospitals?
 Random...?
 Yeh went their earlier, took my blood pressure my arm felt like it was going to fall off =[
 Heh, wuss ;)
 LOL
 haha shhh ;-)  that kinda stuff makes me go all weird
 Have you ever seen how a baby acts when the doctor gives them a shot. Painful to watch
 lol i dont like hospitals either... mainly because i dont have health insurance
 heh i always faint/get close to fainting when i get injections
 Oh dear me
 haha JaXm
 ive had a broken for for almost 3 weeks now...
 broken foot*
 had your checkup today little Ben ?
 Pre-assesment before my op
 Ah
 Do you have all your shots done?
 Nope they just wanted to check i was health for the op :)
 Don't you have to get all yours shots before the OP?
 youre getting op?
 Shame the US doesn't have an NHS, eh, JaXm :p
 Nope had my injections ages ago.
 National honor society?
 Yes DarkKrai
 lol
 National Health Service, part of the welfare state :p
 It does have NHS
 Well they're trying to get one
 The republicans have been quick to point to the NHS as an example of the "evil" of Obama's plans
 True
 Despite the fact we have free healthcare, and we spend less as a porportion of GDP on health
 lol yea it sucks Alex
 i went like 3 months back... had a migraine lasting me over a week nonstop
 That's not normal...
 bastards charged me $2800... and all they did was take my temperature and write me a prescription
 Migraines tend to top out at 72 hours
 yea i know
 Were you under heavy medication before going to the doctor? Some pills tend to worsen migraines 
 Only for some people
 What have you got for it?  Preventatives or stff to stop a migraine when it comes on
 stuff*
 Probably a high dose of IBUprofine
 Hmmm, that's... an odd thing for a prescription
 Besides, ibuprofen and codeine tends to be stronger
 What Iburofine ?
 I know they prescribed me that when I told my doctor about my pain
 Cant you just buy that over the counter ?
 migraine**
 Not the strong ones
 i got Tramadol
 Not bad
 You can get ibuprofen sure, and a stronger dose doesn't seem like a great solution to me :p
 Sounds like an easy way to get headaches once you stop taking the painkillers
 Tramadol is an opioid right?
 yup
 I've got some anti-inflammatory tablets, which prevent migraines from starting in the first place
 nice...
 They keep not wanting to give them to me, I was recommended them by a specialist, but apparently they have protocol for these things and I skipped a few steps up to more complex drugs
 haha xD
 But usually pointing out it was a specialist who recommended them gets it in the end
 That and some sumatriptan
 Hopefully you don't drive while under the influence
 Iv never had a migrain :/
 Count yourself lucky ;)
 Ben when you get more serious into your coding, you will start getting migrains
 They're mostly just boring as hell, because you end up with pain from sounds and light.
 yea
 So you lie down in a dark quiet room for hours
 haha Sazzad, I get Ed to do my code ;-)
 True
 Alex wouldnt you just sleep ?
 they suck... i literrally could not move from my bed... lights off, everything silent, head under the pillow
 With that kind of pain, Ben?
 Good luck
 you cant really get to sleep with that much pain
 ahh ok =[
 Ben when you get migrains, it's hard to fall a sleep some times
 Sleeping pills ?
 Doesn't help
 Makes things worst at times
 Get knocked out ?
 Wow
 lol
 lol after the 5th hour... you kinda jus lay there half awake half asleep... mind is just numb to the world
 Heh, because possible brain damage is a neat solution :p
 hehe
 I also get the nausea bit of migraines, so every two hours or so with a migraine I get to go throw up
 Sazzad next time you get one, get stoned see if that helps ;)
 Yeah, sniff some vicodin
 Are migrains just random or are they caused by something like stress
 ?
 Varies a lot from person to person
 But they usually have some trigger
 Mine are I think related to poor sleep
 ahh ok
 heh bet Ed gets them alot then ;-)
 Other causes can be stress, and in that case there's an odd treatment
 Apparently you can get rid of some of those by botoxing your brow
 I generally get them when I try to debug code and before exams
 lol
 Don't know if it actually works, and it's useless to me :p
 Stress isn't my trigger
 yea mine was stress related
 my job sucked... me and my girlfriend were going thyrough a rough patch... my mom found out she has cancer...
 >.<
 Other common ones are light related, food related (chocoloate, cheese and wine typically)
 yea i heard that caffeine can trigger migraines... but also can take away migraines...
 wich i will admit, sometimes when my migraines kick in, illl have a few cups of coffee and they will dim down a bit..
 Caffeine is a component of some anti-headache/migraine medication
 So I guess there's something to be said for that
 Yup. I also heard about wine.
 Never tried it
 Never tried wine? :p
 Never tried it to remove migraine
 I love wine
 Heh, I mentioned it as a cause, not a solution
 lol
 I heard of it as a type of solution
 I suppose I've decided the best way to deal with an oncoming headache was to go out drinking before
 It's worked once...
 Oh oops I misread the article
 Hehe it said wine would put you on bed for a day in pain
 Missed the part with the pain
 Yeah, mostly I don't consider it a workable solution :p
 And since I'm taking anti-inflammatory stuff to get past this patch of migraines, I can't drink for a while.
 lol send me some :p
 It sort of spoils anti-migraine stuff if you mix it with alcohol to give yourself a migraine ;)
 :D
 installing cs4
 woot
 TIM!! :D

 Message from DarkKrai at 16:58, 19/8/2009: Hello, I am sBot. Robert has installed a new intelligent and experimental opinion plug-in inside of me. My first task was to take notes and tell everyone wha
  what they think of you.  29 out of 29 active users currently dislike you.
 <Cr`eme>Could you tell him to stop that
 <Cr`eme>?
 <Cr`eme>Because it gets annoying
 ....
 lol
 <Robert>As it says it's from DarkKrai, did you really think it was me who sent that?
 He did
 what a retard >.>
 lol, I knew it shows my name
 * Cr`eme is retarded so dont blame me :D
 Haha
 Yes, I can screen shot that
 Publish it on the forum for the world to see
 waah what the fuck si this
 theres something up with my shift key
 its like perma held
 as if its jammed down
 but its not D:
 Clean it ;)
 it started when i held down shit n the thing for filter keys popped up
 Screen driver / knife, pop the key off, get a qtip, give it a clean
 but i clicked cancel D:
 i even checkec
 and its not on
 Pie` it needs a restart :p
 I'm serious
 It's the only way
 Windows I presume? :P
 why would it need a restart
 Ed: yes
 It cancels it
 Honest
 Ah this sticky keys?
 Yep
 no
 REALLY annoying
 sticky keys is when you tap shfit or control ro something of the sort
 % times quickly
 i didnt tap
 i held
 hold it again
 I thought that could be disabled in accessibility options or something
 i tried that luke
 its not even on
 it was never switched on
 http://johnnynine.com/blog/HowToDisableAnnoyingWindowsFilterKeysAndStickyKeys.aspx
 What kind of social media icons should a club site have?
 Twitter, facebook, rss
 Pie` Whatever. It's the thing I'm talking about. When you work out how you're meant to cancel it, let me know
 I always just restart
 digg, stumbleupon Sazzad?
 its happened on my sister laptop before
 and ive fixed that without restarting
 i just cant remember how
 ><
 Well it's hard to get article link, plus not worth it for them since it's mostly gallery
 Pie` - hold down the shift key for like 10 seconds or something
 itll then bring up an option to disable it when ya go into the settings for it
 thats what started it jaxm
 but i clicked cancel
 on the dialogue that opened
 do it again
 dont click cancel... there will be an option to go to the settings for it
 Eh I'll put myspace
 hasnt fixed it jaxm
 everything is unticked still
 hmm
 thats all i ever did and it worked
 hmm 5 ambulances... cant be much good
 By your house?
 wow
 now nothing happens when i hold shift
 Are they wearing white coats Dolleh? I'd hide if I were you ;)
 lol
 they passed my house
 It's a decoy!
 HIDE! NOW!

 5 ambulances for one party though?
 was just waitin till it exploded really :P 
 how do i find the file type from a url in php?

 if(file==zip){something}  xD
 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/310714/how-to-check-file-types-of-uploaded-files-in-php
 ed: that didnt help me
 i did exactly as the guide told me to do

 hmm
 You could try finfo Luke
 !docs finfo_open
 Create a new fileinfo resource
 Informative..
 hm
 !docs finfo_open
 finfo_open [PHP &gt;= 5.3.0, PECL fileinfo &gt;= 0.1.0]
 resource finfo_open ([ int $options  [, string $magic_file  ]] )

 how do I find out what website name do I have?
 You created it tbolanos, you should know, but if you look on http://zymic.com/zcp you'll see the list of domains you've created.
 if you have logged in of course ;)
 lo, is anyone around?
 Don't think so huddy
 Well looked all over my house and safe to report, no one is.
 ;) i just applied for a traffic thing, paid
 ;)
 haha
 I'm afraid you need to talk to Jack about that huddy
 is he on the IRC?
 Not atm
 Thanks guys!
 i assume it's not an automatic thing then, he will set this up manually?
 Has to go through a validation period as a lot of fraudulent purchases have been made in the past which freezes the account linked to it.
 wow.
 hmm
 So a lot of idiots try to exploit the system eh?
 ah okay, any idea on timeframe?
 also, i've purchased 5000 to start with
 Yeah, it's depressing. I think it's about 48 hours huddy, but Jack will need to verify
 how quickly is that number normally take to get 5k hits?
 I'm afraid I don't know the answer to that huddy
 okay no worries :)
 it said, 24 hours on the site o/
 Again, thanks guys, I did it!! I got my website!
 Oh must be 24hours then huddy
 No problem tbolanos, good luck with your site.
 just ordered the smashing book ^-^
 hi there, I can not create a site. I get 404 Page Not Found! status after entering all the info. Anybody knows what this is?

 HEYLLO M LOVLIEs
 timmmeeeeeeh!
 Ive been told
 I shouldnt have mixed my drinks AKA Pernod and Cider
 eek
 Tim, blame it on the alcohol :D
 But then I would if you said pernod with anything :p
 If you are mixing with cider, make sure it's a decent cider, not a cheap one
 All the chemical additives etc to the cheap stuff like Strongbow means you can give yourself a nasty morning after
 Pachy: Yes, I was told, any particular reason to change?
 Security reasons. Better functionality.
 Such as?
 Alex, Bulmers and Kopparberg :D
 Not so keen on the regular kopparberg, like the pear one though, that's just my taste though :p
 Westons is good
 Well, I don't have the docs handy but there's a number of bugfixes, quite a few covering a few glancing security flaws that might tempt someone with sufficient programming knowledge and a sufficient temper to exploit such. Not to mention that having an out of date version of anope might eventually become apparent to the less than desireable types of the internet. (you'd end up fighting off insane botnets trying to take root and ect....)
 Alex
 This is Kopparberg PEAR1
 Haha
 :d
 Tim, stop getting drunk and talk to me :(
 it's just something I always take note of when I visit an IRC network. If I find something that's not up to date I try to give the maintainers of the network a reminder of it so it can get fixed before someone gets the idea to exploit it
 (belive me, I've seen how much damage an immature script kiddy who has access to a botnet can do
 wouldn't want services like this to become more scarce because of jerks who would rip things apart because things don't go their way~
 im so glad I moved up from the world of hoby scripting
 (hard enough as it is to find free hosts without insane restrictions)
 this one seems to be the least restrictive
 (I like parentheses too)

 oh, okay
 cool
 Tim, I upgraded to 3.0 last night
 :D
 :D
 hey yal
 Im on 3.1
 sush
 :P
 then, I jailbroke it
 its  a bit faster now
 better than 2.2.1  :P
 common misconception
 JB makes it slower
 But vastly more useful ;)
 Heafty MobileSubstrate contains many Un needed copies of kernal extensions
 ^
 D:
 all loaded twice on boot
 :D
 * D:
 stop ruining it! :(
 :P
 The substrate is only useful for crash handling and other extentions atm alex
 I was talking about jailbreaking in general
 oh no need to
 You can do anything without doing so
 it was worth it on 1.1 lol
 just use the USB API
 :P
 I have an extacted and unecrypted copy of the 3.0 OS DarkKrai
 :D
 I think I can install spotlight search bilds

 so you can search any apps user info :D
 cool
 what is it?
 http://www.anope.org/news_index.php <-- Alex, I think if you read back to the point where 1.6 branch of anope was last mentioned, you should get an idea of what you're missing out on now
 it's definitely improved in the last two versions

 Now don't go away for more than 14 days

 Haha
 ok so who here knows how to use routers and shitzzle
 It releases your nick
 oh ok
 Luke remember to login to your account next time you sign on to iRC
 msg nickserv identify password
 gotcha
 Not so sure on the 'shitzzle' but I know routers Luke ;)
 is there a way for me to connect my linksys router to my verizon actiontec wirelessly?
 haha
 the shitzzle adds to the effect
 .. normally
 does it support wireless bridging?
 which one
 actiontec?
 i dont think so
 both will need to
 shit. :\
 Do either of them?
 Most access points support bridging in one way or another
 Routers not so much
 Robert, didn't you set one up?
 um im not sure
 Nope
 I tried to persuade Dad to let me try but 'Work's going to do it'
 That was a month ago
 Ahh yeah
 ha
 Apparently they're coming on Tuesday
 Yeah right...
 i got a desktop in the attic that i need to connect to the actiontec in the basement.. i can't connect with a cable.. 
 http://www.mediaatlantic.com/section.php/1651/0
 That will do it
 Quite expensive though
 meh that means money
 i just had an extra linksys router and thought maybe it could work
 ha
 guess not
 What's the model Luke?
 wrt54g
 http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Wireless_Bridge
 Might be able to apply this to your situation
 hm you think it would work with a different router? - the actiontec
 which is quite shitty btw :)
 Possible, you might find some custom firmware for it
 Tim are there any good free twitter apps for the iphone?

 Never tried it before
 Not a clue
 I tend to write musical numbers when drunk :)
 Lol
 If you don't mind a bit of a drop in quality, yes, Sazzad ;)
 Luke now kick whoever you want, except me :-D
 He can't, he only has voice
 woo! voiccce
 Oh yeah
 lol Sazzad vops can't kick ;-)
 Not that I'm anything like consistent in bowling when sober :p
 shut up! i'm happy
 !help
 But I do ok, and I don't use the sides >_>
 haha Alex
 what can i do
 Sides are poop! Bet you use the ramp ;-)
 Wow soo many plugins installed on sBot
 !help
 i was just attacked by growl
 Hah, nah, Ben.  I have some modicum of pride :p
 Even on the days it's gone horribly wrong I still wouldn't
 Besides, they tell you off because we're not kids
 Luke you're on a Mac?
 haha nice xD
 yess
 Not that I'd know or anything
 and btw i fixed my dads old desktop! so now i got TWO macs :)
 course ;-)  I thought anyone could use them.
 I like to use a heavy ball when I bowl :D
 some one said balls...
 lol
 someone said ball*
 TIM
 you have a mac right?
 I do
 He has many.
 do you use coda?
 Haha, you have to ask?
 yes.
 :)
 I do
 and I paid :)
 hah ok
 um can you test a plugin
 i made :D
 Does coda have a free version?
 not for you
 nope
 WHY.
 it's reall special
 I think nope was for me
 oh :)
 what does it do Luke
 Ben: I use what is a 12 where I go, slightly skewed towards the heavier ones
 I think they go from something like 6 to 18
 Or 16
 it allows you to grab scripts from a repository to create new projects
 its supposed to ... :)
 has anyone here ver used aptana ?
 Coda has SVN
 :/
 no locally
 ahh nice, i tend not to use the ones where my fingers just fit in the holes because I get scared it might pull my fingers off ;-)
 I don't understand how people use the ones for "small" fingers
 They're tiny :p
 I normaly use around a 14
 Yeh
 like a repository on your computer of your own scripts just to make faster projects
 Ben is your project done?
 sure there's a better way but it was just a little experiment :P
 Sazzad sure is, probably quite a few bugs but I guess thats what my error logger and beta testing is for xD
 Did Ed do most of the coding for you?
 Nope, he helped me with the upload a bit logic wise like how to do it.
 Ah
 I had most of it done anyway from WinUp.
 What's the file size?
 as I put my kneck on the line
 xD
 kneck
 1.45MB  Yeh its pretty big, but thats because I use icons in it that are like 250kb each. Iv talked to chris about resizing them so its a LOT smaller but he doesn't care about the size.
 hehe Tim xD
 hats how I spelt it Sazzard
 :/
 Thanks

 Why do people spell it like that: Sazzard
 There are no freking R's in my name at all!
 stfu ben
 WTF
 Mad random
 If if comes on again ima kill him
 if someone has him on msn tell gim that!
 Ban his IP
 Don't know it.
 Track it from the forum
 YESH
 Or?
 We could ignore it
 I think banning = better solution
 It's either we're like the world (going out fighting) or like Canada (sit back and watch)
 the world does not include France
 hahaha
 Good job MrTouz isn't here
 Yeah I looked for him before I wrote that
 Canada?  They aren't properly neutral, you want the Swiss, they do it right ;)
 Aww Alex you killed Russel Peters joke
 Well, he's biased
 Besides, the joke was already over :p
 If I were really trying to put a damper on the joke...
 Nah, even for the sense of irony it isn't worth doing
 hmm im bored, might learn COBOL.
 http://dznr.org/qfr1 NEEDS WHITE NEON BULBS AND BLACK 18"
 It was good knowing you, Ben
 haha am I going ?
 It's a shame they don't have much internet connectivity for sectioned patients
 lmao, Ed managed to get it.
 I resent that Ben! *pulls out a hidden blade and lurches towards Ben*
 :O
 I should point out, that's not insanity, he just lives in London
 That's how they say hello :)
 WHO WHAT ?!?
 Alex good buy ? http://www.amazon.com/COBOL-Dummies-Arthur-Griffith/dp/0764502980
 If there is a good or bad book on COBOL, it's by a degree so small it's not worth mentioning :p
 hehe
 Gotta go
 Talk to you late
 later**
 Bye
 Don't forget to ask mummy Sazzad to read you a bedtime story!
 cya
 There is a market for COBOL still, lots of legacy applications, but I don't think you'd really find it much fun
 hmm ok I'll cross it off my list and move on to objc
 :D
 It's almost entirely maintenance of existing complicated systems
 Typically in the financial industry
 ahh
 Since that's what COBOL was made for originally, there was a time when banks/etc used to work pretty much just in COBOL
 And so now it sits around in old mainframes like a disease :p
 Probably with a few helper scripts written in perl
 haha cool
 I imagine it will get replaced almost completely in the next... 50 years
 But it won't happen until almost all of the people who understand COBOL are dead
 And so the cost of maintaining it ends up too high
 My Mum learned COBOL back in the day :p
 She was trained as an accountant, and that was one of the things you did.
 To give an impression of just how big it was in finance, that even the accountants learned it back before the days of personal computing
 Or at least, not general personal computing
 wow never realised it was that big.
 COBOL for business, FORTRAN for science, Lisp for weird people ;)
 hehe

 It's been a long time since I actually used any of it.
 Ha ok
 You missed us having fun with languages yesterday :P
 ??
 Greg speaks pretty good French
 AlbSpirit has a .fr host, but he hasn't been on in a while
 Tim was speaking in German, I was speaking in French
 Looking through logs for frenchies :p
 Jack, why not bring them onto IRC and use sBot? :P
 !translate on Ed
 They left
 Mon Francais c'est terrible
 Ed: My French is terrible
 !translate on Alex
 Tu a parle Francais Alex?
 Ed: You speak French was Alex?
 Ed, tu est un poulet petit
 Alex: Ed, you are a chicken little
 Alex, Femme le bouche!
 Or is it the other way around, I forget how adjectives are ordered
 Ed: Alex, Male mouth!
 Ferme
 Ed: Farm
 Fermme
 f'emme

 Je habite desous mon tante
 Ed: I live my aunt DeSousa
 Je habite dessous ma tante
 Ed: I live below my aunt
 Heh, sure you should be admitting to that? :p
 It does need simple language to be very useful

 Ed: Why not?
 Spelt it right that time :P

 I swear this all in the wrong tense... but hey.

 Not really
 Dolleh?
 rebel?
 pah, 1 sec
 !translate off Ed
 Enough bad french
 sorry, wablief?
 I've been wondering about getting back into a language, probably German
 Just because I'm friends with a German IRL
 And well, he speaks perfect English... but why not :p
 Foreigners pick up English far too easily.
 D: DONT LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT!!! :O
 but it's true
 I was thinking of having a test
 gawd were poor victims of irc D:
 Intel is making a ultra-thin laptop :)
 With Dolleh and rebel we can have dutch, arabic and english all at the same time
 :P
 we're*
 damn you! XD
 Brandon: how much thin ?
 `ping
 PONG
 Yes, I wonder what qualifies as "ultra-thin" as well :p
 Are we talking the width of one PCB with an OLED screen stuck on top, that'd be pretty thin
 But that would have to be a proof of concept, too expensive to be plausible
 It says "Imaging thinest laptop on earth" so possibly thinner than a MacBook Air :P
 Rebel ^
 Opps.. the thinest*
 aha
 this music is win http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQRdqi-GCfc
 YouTube - Qadaysh kan fi nas ÙØ¯ÙØ´ ÙØ§Ù ÙÙ ÙØ§Ø³ -- Rated 5.0 Stars
 rebel, it's nice, but the piano could do with a tune/complete overhaul...
 what's that ?
 Your youtube link
 The piano isn't very good
 I think I hear what you mean, in the low end
 The music's nice, but could be better because of it
 It sounds a bit off, hard to tell really with this kind of recording / audio quality though
 It was the opening notes
 Yes, very low.
 wekk here's the original song
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zyh4KVKL_Vk
 YouTube - Fairouz - Addeysh kan Fi Nas / ÙØ¯ÙØ´ ÙØ§Ù ÙÙ ÙØ§Ø³ -  ÙÙØ±ÙØ² -- Rated 5.0 Stars
 well*
 Hmm?  I was saying the low notes were the ones that sounded more off-key :p
 Rebel, when Tim is on get him to play it :p
 Me too, Alex :p
 Sure ;)
 I dunno about the starting ones, there's a bit of a distorted sound from those, but when the camera which presumably has the mic in it is sitting actually on the piano
 It's hard to say
 Yes...
 Not my type of music :P
 I don't listen to much that's mostly piano, I should listen to more really, I like the piano as an instrument.
 Me too, Tim has played some quite good pieces
 It's better in person usually
 :P
 Certainly I prefer listening to a piece played in person rather than a recording, dunno why really
 Good song! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqDpD298zAE
 YouTube - Tinchy Stryder feat. Amelle - Never Leave You -- Rated 4.5 Stars

 That's one I have heard in person ;)
 Not played by him
 5.1 surround sound does sound good though
 I think my speakers are breaking...
 Whenever I change the volume they rustle
 ...Great.
 Wow
 Sorry Guys about the many users
 :s
 T_T
 Dolleh: ?
 Cr`eme: That would be a ID 10 T error ;-)

 STUPID WINDOWS

 Cr`eme: No you're not O_o
 Don't even bother with him Sazzad :-P.
 Dolleh, ssshhhhh so Sazzad doesnt find where you are :OO
 I hate it when they have to leave =(
 OK so go to this link: http://www.iwrite.jorsek.com/home
 I'm not sure why but there is a freking turquoise background color behind the flash
 Cr`eme you don't know html, you always ask me for help :/
 I ask for the css
 But that site is an exact clone of http://iwritemarketing.com/index.html
 not the html :P
 Why does it have a freking background
 ED
 I need help
 I know Brandon can't solve this one
 HOMG Ed Sazzad NEEDS YOUR HELP :o
 Sazzad, Ed doesn't do HTML ;-)
 Sazzad, what is your problem?
 So you're shit out of luck unless Alex helps :p
 BUt he does know more than you about html
 :P
 Ed, knows a lot more things then i know :O
 Probably more about computers but I cant judge other things
 And you thought that up all on your own? Well done :)
 Sazzad you tried looking for the colour code in your files?
 #00ffff
 :OOOOOO Ben IS SMART
 Yes
 Cr`eme seem to have caught the Dolleh virus.
 Hey kdigennaro 
 hey
 :D
 im ordering free stickers lol
 :P
 Can I have some too
 URGH brandon why you used my name and its name in ONE sentance? ;_;
 Y_Y
 yeah sec ill give u link
 Exactly.
 kdigennaro, mee too please :o)
 kk
 :>
 Hmm Sazzad, odd.
 Me too, kdigennaro.
 I know
 ED: there is no way in the black heaven that error should be occuring
 Are you sure?
 Yup
 I'm using the same exact files and code
 It does not make sense.
 What's the background in the flash set to Sazzad?
 And another annyoing thing is that firebug hates flash, so it doesn't inspect it properly
 Nop
 As you can see here: http://iwritemarketing.com/index.html
 i love free stickers lol
 Same flash file
 kevin send me the link :-D
 :O lINKS :dddddddd
 Ah it's def in your CSS Sazzad 
 here u go, http://www.freakyfreddies.com/sticker.htm
 i havent actually got any yet but seems legit so far :P
 Sazzad
 http://iwritemarketing.com/images/backgroundGradient.gif < what....
 I never used that color in my CSS
 That seems to look like a gradient ;-)
 You know? The one that's on the background? :o
 Hmm, take that back, I was deleting elements in the HTML with firebug and I removed the css files and it disappeared, trying that again now and no suck luck
 suck? :p
 I'll pass thank you Brandon 
 Why?
 Ed Which CSS file did you remove?
 It's the background of the flash Sazzad, try adjusting the dimensions of it, you see it appear
 ya got 5 stickers so far! lol
 I tried but it's not allowing me to adjust the size
 wheres TheOracle :{
 Oh wow just fixed it
 lol 4-6 weeks till i get my sticker :(
 What was it Sazzad?
 So when I called the flash file, i put a space before and after the quote tags
 var so = new SWFObject("<xsl:value-of select="$kit_location"/>/css/web/images/home.swf ", " mymovie "
 Darn annoyin
 annoying*
 Me and my coding team spent nearly 2 hours figuring out why the problem was occuring.
 kdigennaro what sticker ? :(

 Don't you have the last 20 lines of chat?

 Alex: You a fan of pear cider ?
 Not necessarily a fan, but I drink it
 I've had a couple of bottles tonight
 not acctually had it before, heh
 Like it?
 It's not bad
 If you do you might try and find some perry
 I think i like it more than plain cider
 Yeah, I would probably get pear cider over most normal cider, but not all.
 That said I tend to go for continental / local / premium lager mostly these days, it's just easy to drink :p
 Basically excluding all the crap like Fosters, Carling, non-export Carlsberg etc

 Hey TheOracle 
 BEN!!! :O
 YOU FAILED HOMG
 Dolleh msn died =[
 Sorry =[
 D:
 IT WAS 50% BEN D:
 DAM!!
 What are you two talking about?
 I'm guessing a MSN file transfer?
 Sharing pics no doubt
 hehe
 wow Windows 7 is slow today :/
 Oi! None of that!
 some prog must be leaking
 Get yourselves a #room for that!
 o_O
 On irc.house.com!
 its TinyGrab
 Does that exist?
 http://grab.by/26r
 Large for an app of its size I guess
 It appears now
 not*
 But that shouldn't have a noticeable effect on the system
 well it dies
 does*
 It's still only ~35MB allocated memory.
 That's not a large amount by current standards
 thats the largest allocated memory in the window
 Is it memory that's maxed, or is the CPU spiking?
 maxed
 although the CPU did just spike
 That didn't answer the question
 when tinygrab started -> http://grab.by/26s
 when it took that screenshot -> http://grab.by/26t
 and so on
 in the second spike it was taking 99% of the CPU
 Ah, good old ugly line graphs :p
 yep, they just couldn't change them :/
 I really like the fact KDE made their system monitor SVG
 http://grab.by/26A again spiked CPU on startup
 Nicer looking graphs, not something you really prioritise, but you notice it
 Spiking on starting an app is not uncommon.
 indeed but it maintains
 http://grab.by/26B
 Well, that would seem more likely to be the issue rather than memory
 true
 at the moment I only have 57~8 MB free RAM
 http://grab.by/26C
 You shouldn't have much free RAM
 How much of that is cache?
 307 MB
 Right, that's fine then
 That's perfectly normal, no worry
 When I closed tinygrab the free went to 77~6 MB though
 And if your system is working properly
 If you waited a bit
 The free memory would decrease again
 And "standby" would increase
 its not
 It doesn't happen instantaneously
 free(willy)
 Standby is cache memory, which should be as much as is possible
 "Free" should be as close to 0MB as possible in a healthy system
 You only start worrying if the combined "standby" and "free" gets low
 And at the moment from what you pasted you had 340-350MB RAM spare for utilisation
 true
 but it appears that McAfee is the most resource intensive, which is logical
 however TinyGrab comes up second
 http://files.pastesite.com/screenshots/apps/ksysguard.png that's how graphs are done nicely ;)
 TheOracle I told you windows memory management is shit and it gives applications more memory that they need look here http://www.devcity.net/newsletter/archive/devcity/devcity20030928.htm scroll down to ".NET Upgraders: The Memory Mystery" :P

 does varname.length return the length of a string as well as the values in an array?
 or is there like, len(str)
 Python I'm guessing? Yeah, there's a len(str)
 %py len
 TheOracle: len(s) Returns the length (the number of items) of an object.
 ;)
 so its compat with str, list, tuple iirc
 oh no, i meant javascript
 i neglected to mention that :P
 oh, no that's just str.length() Pie`, you can make your own function if really needed
 *str.length
 I'm writing a messenger plus script :D

 header("Location: blerg"); ?
 That also doesn't set the referrer header
 no it sets the location
 Just because you move your hips doesnt mean that you exist
 It would be my preferred choice though
 header("Referrer: blerg");
 I want the external website I'm referring to to have the page I'm on as the referrer

 DarkKrai worse than Cr`eme ?

 I think so Ben
 or i'll bust YOU up

 I find threats consisting of physical violence on the Internet are...pathetic and useless :/
 ^
 Therefore you're just degrading yourself as you threaten others
 :O nowai

 Then sBot will do it
 Robert why are you a Plague now?
 I don't think thats very healthy :p
 Ok lemme learn php quick
 Well, we have Death in #hosting
 You want the hook section
 lmao xD
 Set an initial var to FALSE on construct
 Check in hook for time
 Then put message
 I suggest $this->irc->put("Ben", "PRIVMSG", "WAKE UP");
 Or something
 :O short!
 2 lines declaring vars
 I may actually start using my laptop as an alarm clock xD
 1 line setting inital var
 wow nice :)
 1 line including irc
 So more more reliable, Ed or sBot ? ;)
 4 lines for the hook section
 sBot
 :O
 Ed may be asleep
 Ed never goes to sleep :p
 ^
 hehe
 Plague send me template then? :D
 the eed dictionary doesn't contain the word "sleep" 
 ed*
 what about snooze ?
 I bet nap is in there though
 http://dznr.org/6h6t

 yup, nap is in there
 how did you know TO?
 Only "Food" "Code" "Zymic" are in there.

 BEN idiot..
 And we've won the ashes
 wow this pub/priv key concept is pretty cool
 ?
 That's the correct way to do DIY
 ;)
 lol
 how does Ed get it done?
 What are you using the drill for Rob?
 It's fairly boring
 I get it done by looking like I know what I'm doing and screwing up and blaming the tools :P
 New house (march) only just putting up a hook for my dressing gown
 Aha, a drill really needed for that? :P
 It's got a very slight (1mm over the width) lean, down on the left
 Pilot holes
 I would of thought a braddle would of sufficed
 The irish hammer approach wasn't enough
 Why bother with that
 *?
 If you've got the tools to do it properly...
 True, when you've got the chance to use electric tools use them :P
 And, tbh, I spent this morning playing with a chainsaw
 A bradle is just pathetic after that
 Haha, really getting into the DIY then :P
 No, that was outside, in an SSSI
 And strimmed the reeds down
 Pro.
 Better than burning it down as they tried 5? years ago
 They ended up needing the fire brigade
 And running off before they got there to not get into trouble
 Slick, obviously ran out of napalm.
 I'll suggest that for next year!
 Will make Tiger Grass very easy!
 in a mysql update query, to update multiple fields do i just seperate each field with a , ?
 ie: UPDATE `table` SET `field1` = 1, `field2` = 2
 Yup Pie` 
 bbl

 BBC NEWS | Technology | UK file-sharers to be 'cut off'
 That will NEVER work
 Previously they were agreeing with that, and saying net access has become too important to cut people off via legislation
 the government is aiming to turn off the internet from the ISP's side for users that download files illegally, but the government isn't goign to pay for any of this
 Alex:
 "European politicians recently ruled that cutting off someone's internet connection could be a breach of their human rights."
 Yes, I meant UK's policy writers though
 So this is a stupid change of opinion.
 but the government is going to force the Content law holders and the ISP's to pay for all this
 and the ISP's are saying no to all of it
 I shouldn't be surprised at rampant idiocy though, it is Labour still

 Hello everybody!
 Hello
 Robert - I do too
 This guy...
 He's asked me to turn his html into a template for his site
 Fine, that's reasonable
 1st: His site wasn't working - I fixed that, extra
 2nd: His current template has 3 menus, normal, user, admin
 His new template doesn't
 I set him writing more menus
 3rd: his new template is worse than his old one...
 haha xD
 He paying you ?
 4th: he just sent me his new menu's, but sent the WRONG zip file
 Yes#
 Yes
 Hopefully over $200
 Lmao sounds like a good client xD
 Robert is it that Dwayne person of forums ?
 No
 And no Sazzad...
 :-O
 But I will fight for extra due to fixing his site

 Min prize is like a pen
 Which will cost you £6 in call fee's
 But maybe not ;)
 Not on this one, £1.50 per min phone call will be no more than 6mins. Min prize for the cash one is £10 so either way I'd get £1 xD
 dunno what the min prize is for the other one
 That's when they ask you to call back 3 more times ;)

 is a 320GB Hard drive big enough?
 For 100GB, yes
 for 400GB, no
 what..
 You haven't said what this HD is for
 So we can't answer
 lol
 well its for this laptop, http://www.pcworld.co.uk/martprd/store/pcw_page.jsp?BV_SessionID=@@@@1488029040.1251309583@@@@&BV_EngineID=cccladeieekkdlhcflgceggdhhmdfho.0&page=Product&fm=null&sm=null&tm=null&sku=883912&category_oid=-36730
 im running a 250 gig in my laptop and I haven't filled it yet...
 My computer is 4 years old, and still has 64GB free out of 145GB
 You'll be fine with that
 it honestly depends on what you are planning to store
 so it's a pretty good laptop for the price do you think?
 15.6" screen is what puts me off of it
 About $1,300
 betarepeating, it's about double i think
 1,134.82379 US$
 I think
 betarepeating, http://www.google.co.uk/#hl=en&source=hp&q=%C2%A3699.99+to+%24&btnG=Google+Search&meta=&aq=f&oq=%C2%A3699.99+to+%24&fp=458d05167c37f829
 google knows all ^_^
 heh yeh
 lol that's exactly what I did
 Today, my temp agency sent me out for an interview for a great job. The interviewer and I hit it off. She asked if I could start later today. She said she'd call after making up a contract. She didn't call. My temp agency called to tell me the interviewer was fired right after my interview. FML
 hmmm. looks decent. tbh that sounds a bit pricey for a laptop like that
 mm
 i was looking at another laptop
 Tesco do some alright deals on laptops
 but seems as pcworld website is stupid and the in-store staff know next to nothing even about there own website, it sort of didn't work
 Ed, i wanted to use pcworld as they're around the corner for me and with any problems I can easy drop it into them if broke and they'll fix and tell me when to go collect it
 Heh, you expect them to fix it? ;)
 yes, i've had computers from them before, they're prett good
 pretty*
 I prefer comet
 Mufia: probably not relevant for you in terms of actual purchase as I don't know if you have best buy wherever you are, but look at this: http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=9371262&type=product&id=1218093384107
 You can do deals with them in there too ;)
 that's just a few model numbers off from yours, but it's practically half the price
 Ed, what do you mean, them to nock off some money etc?
 ty betarepeating i'll take a look :)
 Yup Mufia, just ask to talk to the manager.
 yeah, it's an idea althou they're all....not to smart
 they'll chuck in software etc, or a mouse to seal the deal
 I was helping the guy in there use his own website...
 lol I've done stuff like that
 he said "i usually work in the ware house but they needed me here today"
 i was like, yeh it shows
 the tech salesmen don't like it when a 16 year old corrects them on their  tech specs

 i was like *sigh*

 yes and two other variations
 he's got an older brother that is really spooky scary
 D3d is really an intelligent programmer
 Nice
 I noticed some of the plugins were nice
 he's really heavy into AI when he's not programming security codes and doing security checks for some corps
 wtf? how did it ban me?
 Wick3d has intelligence
 D3d could be the father of the proverbial Skynet from the Terminator
 hA
 tell D3d to unban me then
 D3d's prob sleeping

 Thanks Ed, heh im please concidering not much revision went into the subjects (apart from Geography which I got the A in).
 You're just doing a single award GCSE for English?
 urm 9 Alex
 I thought pretty much everyone was doing the double :p
 Yeh we did the double.
 I did co-ordinated science instead of seperate science thats why i didn't do 14 GCSE's like some people.
 English is where I got one of my Bs
 We did the science double award
 Which was a bit of an odd middle ground
 fuck
 hit crop instead
 I think they're putting the top/middle sets onto the triple science at my secondary now
 The science i did you could get 2 GCSE's, the other one (seperate) there was 3 GCSE's and they got to do an RE GCSE.
 Yeah, you did the same as me then
 But I still did 11 :p
 What did you do ?
 Uh, lesse if I can remember them all
 Everony who did the science I did  (majority of the year) only did 9.
 Jacob it's creepy
 Wrong creditials
 Here, watch
 ok
 A*: Maths, Double science, History.  A: Geography, English Lang, Statistics, Electronics.  B: French, ICT, English Lit
 I admit I had to check my CV for some of those ;)
 I know about nick, port, standard, domain and ident bans
 Ok, then why are yours not working?
 But whats the command for removing
 haha nice Alex! Aahh only top set maths did statistics xD
 4 marks of an A =[
 No real loss there, Ben :p
 It was boring as hell, and it was a three hour exam I think
 With a paper that took 30 minutes
 haha wow
 Afternoon :)
 Do GCSE's really matter that much Alex compared to A levels when going for a job ?
 Well, if you don't take a core subject to A level then they might make sure you have a decent GCSE in it
 English is a core subject yeh ?
 But provided you've got a C or above in maths, science and english, I think they only look at your A levels
 Ok :) I got that phew!
 Oh wait I did get a D in business studies as well xD
 No real loss there though ;)

 What a shit wordpress theme
 heh i think their default one is naff
 LOL
 It's better than many other available on the web
 It is shite house really
 Sazzad: You CSS Sprites are broken
 They don't work
 Where?
 shrub
 That project is long done
 I got tired of it
 Damn you ed
 Should ban him on all three channels
 Teach him not to have a norm life
 :O
 I don't think he does
 <_<
 I don't feel like doing any work at the office
 All in flavour of banning Ed to teach him a lesson say I
 I banned him on hosting the other day, had to unban him yesterday ;)
 Ha
 Ben: Did he get angry?
 Nope :)
 Bit foolish really, it's not like you can keep him out :p
 It's not like Ed to get angry
 Ed doesn't get angry, he gets even
 How old is Ed anyways
 I did him a favour Alex ;)
 24?
 Yeah forced him to see the sunlight
 Finally got time to leave Jack's basement
 ^
 It'sa wrap for the time being, c u's after a bit
 Anyone know anyone in Brazil please?
 does anyone know why the Potsdam declaration was brought out ?
 O______O
 Pie` you doing history yeh ?
 Having a debate with a friend
 hes american, thinks hes > *
 Ahh ok xD I love history :)
 Doy ou know anything about the Potsdam declaration ?
 I'm doing GCSE history :D
 **NWS** - http://hunterhastings.net/showme/ - it's a resteraunt, not a porn site, just the image they wanted me to use O_O - feedback? never done anything like it before...
 hai ben <3
 Never heard of the term Potsdam Declaration, but I know what happened at Potsdam and the decision that were made/carried out.
 Relates with Yalta.
 Hey Hastings :)
 the Potsdam declaration was related to hiroshima
 whats crackin'
 Looks good hastings
 it was for the immediate surrender of japan or else it would face destruction
 which was hiroshima
 ahhh you must be learing different stuff than we did then.
 I read it on wikipedia ;D
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potsdam_Declaration
 utlined the terms of surrender for the Empire of Japan as agreed upon at the Potsdam Conference. This ultimatum stated that if Japan did not surrender, it would face "prompt and utter destruction."
 hehe ;)
 MY GCSE's are gonna suk bawls :L
 I got a G for english in my mocks
 a D in history
 (was a combined score of a G and a B or something)
 Dw Pie` I only got 1 pass in my mocks in January, and after no revision (apart from Geography) I passed all grades above B, bar 1 which I got a D xD
 I've never been good at english :L
 I got a level 5 in my SAT's
 Can't remember what the levels were
 I have a feeling the SATs before GCSE go up to around level 8 or so
 Expected level is 5 or 6
 Which was my KS2 results ;)
 Tut tut Alex ;)
 I know, unfair of me to be meeting KS3 grades in year 6 ;)
 A levels are certainly much more interesting than GCSE and previous
 You basket =[
 I think I may die with the essays though.
 Wouldn't know, none of my subjects were essay subjects ;)
 Which I quite liked, I prefer exams
 hehe I chose 3 essay subjects =[
 Im thinking of changing IT to one of the sciences though or possibly maths, not sure though.
 :{
 whoo thanks :)
 Hey Ben, what happened to that project you were working on?
 Hey Sazzad, I haven't worked on it much recently beause of my operation etc... not really feeling up to coding. It's still around though, I was just thinking about doing it now. Re-written it though in a different language :)
 ben, the best pancakes ever:  http://fraeuleinamok.deviantart.com/art/kitty-pancake-75852102

 is anyone here good with phpbb 2 forums?
 Amped: Coding or operating?
 well just a little help in general: how to make it so you dont have to activate your account through email (since zymic doesnt support that email thing :)
 Amm...been a while since i"ve played with it.
 Not sure
 when I say activate account through email I mean when a new user sign's up
 um okay, the link is http://amped.vndv.com/forums
 you can register fine, but then when you click the actual 'register' button it says soemthing about the mailer.php not working or something, it does actually sign the member up and they can post and everything except I don't want it to link to this page after you click register with an ugly URL saying /forums/templates/mailer.php whatever
 Sorry Amped. Look around or a solution on the web. No luck
 haha ben, I got message from kitty pancake girl XD lol
 Did she say where she got it from?

 Pie`: Just had a thought
 This morning, you signed up to my script with a user name of """"
 What happened?
 Did you get the confirmation email?
 it told me an email was sent ot the email I registered with
 I duno, i registered with admin@hotmail.com :D
 ...
 Helpful
 very
 good job Pie` !
 so what'd the email say
 Just a link to confirm the email address
 I'm wondering what happened to the string, that's all
 Robert, you got paid for the script yet?
 No, not yet
 It'll be a few days
 I haven't finished it yet
 oh okey
 ah
 Just doing changing email now
 But I'll be surprised if I don't
 haha
 You haven't seen the messages
 And it's a useful script to have anyway
 I'll go get a quote from one of his messages
 I must say you have a particular way of generating confidence in your abilities and your knowledge through a very fast understanding...
 give me source
 It may not be entirely grammatically correct...
 Source?
 A potential client
 pastebin.com
 You mean context
 Not source
 no

 When I try to use fsockopen in php it fails, zymic does not support the function fsockopen in php!
 that's right Happeh
 Why?
 security issues
 ... I'm disapointed.
 Can we fix it? No?
 they used to take one time 10$ payment but I'm not sure they're still doing it
 you'll have to ask an admin @ #hosting
 Like?
 Hello?!
 Robert: do you still accept 10$ payment for turning safe mode off ?
 rebel, not for safe mode
 We do $10 for mail()
 and $10 for mx records
 $15 for both
 he left anyway 
 But for future info
 hello, any admin here?
 i need help
 Please move to #hosting and ask there
 i want girls,web sex,skype?

 Hey Dave :)
 heya Brandon
 What' up?
 Hey Robert
 Hello
 Just had my biggest row with my mother for about a year
 Over the stupidest thing
 What' that?
 I'm currently using her laptop while I'm away
 She uses IE7
 Uh, oh.. :p
 I hate IE, so asked if I could install chrome, she said yes as long as it didn't mess anything up (she always adds that due to an event 10?15? years ago. Nothing has gone wrong since, but I know she'll count this as going wrong)
 does anyone know anything about a new ipod touch coming out in september?
 So, I've be using chrome, no problem
 To 'enforce' them being separate however, I did not import passwords
 I have not set it as the default browser
 :p
 I have not installed any shortcuts
 I have a single link in the program start menu
 Why, what happened in them few years back, Robert?
 So, this morning...
 My bro and I installed a game and their computer messed up
 This was in 95?
 Mum's been paranoid ever since
 So I'm coding this morning
 Rofl..
 And mum asks if she can have 2 minutes on the computer
 I say yes, but wanting to go back on leave chrome up
 She starts using it
 Then complains that none of the auto fills work
 lol
 This only escalates when we suggest she uses IE
 as she always does
 She's been ranting and raving about 'you should just leave things as they are' ect ect
 I HAVE
 She was the one who used something different
 psh, users
 they know nothing!
 But the normal thing IS STILL THERE
 Doesn't help that some of her friends made a few unhelpful comments which just made her more angry
 And I know dad will notice when he sees her
 She'll get her side of the story out
 If my mother was getting all shirty with me I would have head butted her for not knowing what's going on and happening xD.
 And then I'll get a bigger bollocking from him
 tsk tsk Brandon
 XD
 He might be more willing to listen, as he knows what she can be like
 but he'll still be on her side
 Oh, to top it off...
 Robert get in there first
 "Dad, me and mum had an argument earlier..."
 give him your side
 Because the autofil wasn't working
 Thus the page wasn't working
 Thus 'This new thing isn't working'
 So she closed chrome, not her tab, losing all my tabs
 Why don't you have your own laptop, Robert?
 She is why I want to move out
 I will from next week
 Good :-P
 Going back to the one I got in 2001...
 Oh..
 Not so good haha
 But installing a linux to make it much faster
 :)
 Indeed... But will stop this
 Debian?
 I'm not sure what mum and dad have done to it, they claim it doesn't have a fully legal version of windows
 It always used to
 No, something more user friendly
 ubuntu?
 I'll ask Ed when he's here, was what I did last time!
 Or Fedora
 I like Fedora =)
 you cant get more user friendly then ubuntu :P
 And worked very well until hardware failure
 Indeed
 11:14  up 26 days, 14:41, 2 users, load averages: 0.77 0.48 0.47
 Still won't be friendly enough whenever mum looks at it
 :P
 Brandon: That probably means you haven't installed updates
 It's up to date.
 Well... 26 days ago :p
 Indeed
 Nothng since
 Nothing*

 :p
 CrysisCode ?
 And that goes with that code how?
 Starts with C :P
 CoderBase
 Or code
 To be fair, if you're going with a link to that code, it's not particularly memorable
 So you'd be looking for recommendations, not really other advertising :p
 Making the name not as important as "Robert Sworder" in terms of searching
 Sworder xD
 Facebook wouldn't let him register with it :)
 Why not? ;o
 Rude word filter
 I assume
 holy cow, you can make servers in php XD
 ?
 That or it just assumed it was a fake name ;)
 He had to register with Dyper instead
 Oh.. Diaper LOL>
 Surely he could talk to them and get them to change it?
 I don't think he cared enough
 Fair enough
 Pie`: Yes, of course you can
 I recon it'd be messy, but it'd work
 PHP is only an abstraction layer for (C++?)
 Um, well, no.
 Isn't that what it's written in?
 Or am I missing the point here?
 It's mostly written in C, but that doesn't make it an abstraction layer for C
 In the end, PHP is interpreted and turns into opcodes
 It's not turned into C or anything
 Ah, OK
 It's just C doing it
 Compiled C
 You can load extra modules, or write in extra support in C if you want
 PHP itself is turing complete though, and has good network support
 So a server is a feasible project, I wouldn't recommend it though
 Lack of threading, not exactly efficient ;)
 Java is a good language for building a server
 Heh, that would be why everyone writes them in Java... oh wait :p
 !quote grab Alex

 Really needs context...
 So I may delete it on my next check

 Dwayne: hello
 Whats up?
 NOt a great deal man
 How is thr application coming along?
 Haven't been able to talk to my friend yet
 we're busy doing missions.
 I have looked into the back end of the system and it seems pretty alright
 Yeah? You can pull it off?
 I'm pretty picky about things, and want a few shit done :X
 Yea man
 All easy
 Missions, eh?  That's a word I don't here too often outside of discussing computer games or watching military themed films
 I think Brandon was losing his mind with me, lol
 brb

 :o host.me is up for auction
 :O
 nice Jack
 I will win it!
 haha
 hey jack
 lol
 Tim has a wikipedia entry now lmao
 %wik Tim Davies
 "Tim Grant Davies (born September 13, 1990) is a British (German born) Developer who has recently focused on writing iPhone software after six years in web development." - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Davies
 He wants to know who made it XD
 one of his friends he said
 lolol
 http://twitter.com/tmdvs/status/3602224165
 Jack: 
 "host.me is a premium domain and has not yet been scheduled for release."
 lol
 you read below that
 about other premium domains with .me selling for
 "Please inform me when domain is scheduled for auction."
 its not up for auction, YET
 jack does not read that, he just wants it, LOL
 why does j@ck want host.me anyway
 whats so good about that domain?
 ...
 Pie` 
 ?
 Why don't you go to namejet.com ;)
 The official auction site for .me
 Will be on there
 http://www.namejet.com/Pages/AdvancedSearch.aspx?term=host
 highest bid $200
 sept. 27 2009
 Preorder
 yup
 I know
 why do you want host.me?
 :p
 I was stating it will be up for auction
 Would be nice subdomain
 would it?
 how?
 i thought host.com would be better
 >.<
 "Host Me", read it as English
 ?
 yeh
 cblair91
 but hostme.com then is better
 not really
 Sure you pay the million for host.com
 lol
 ?
 just Host Me!
 :D
 not
 Price has something to do with things
 jack, can you host me dot com
 >.>
 yes
 host dot me sounds better
 than the extra dot com
 zymic.me sounds better :D
 jack, will you zymic me :D
 name raep
 *_*
 huh
 host_me.jack
 .j@ck isn't a TLD
 :p
 .,/^.^\,.
 and I doubt it ever will be
 well
 lets hack a .jack domain
 Unless you want to pay the millions they're planning to get to allow companies to make their own like .ibm :p
 they don't exist
 If they're still planning on doing that
 erm
 just hack
 you can't hack the Domain Name System
 pay a brilliant hacker about £500 and he will get you a .jack
 Haha
 lol
 Sure, and even if it worked there's no chance of any negative repurcussions of that
 repercussions*
 Alex you misspelt something? It must be the end of time
 Alex, you can hack?
 The end of time? :S
 Sure, I hack all the time, because I consider hacking under the original definition, not the media one :p
 :p
 i can get a hacker alex
 http://www.namejet.com/Pages/Auctions/BackorderDetails.aspx?domainname=cumbunny.com
 I'm sure you can dear, now hush the adults are talking
 lol
 oh, thank you very much
 Jack2 thats a nice domain thar
 shall i invite one to the irc
 Wouldn't be the first time, and what's the point
 You're not going to impress anyone
 no, but we might get a host_me.jack domain
 Seriously, you think no one would notice, and it wouldn't result in police charges?
 Even /if/ they could do it
 erm
 I don't think ICANN would be very happy at all
 I don't know why you're still going on about this
 It's ridiculous
 people managed to hack into the pentagon, and that ddi not result in police charges
 Such as?  There's a brit currently being extradited for exactly that
 but still
 Likely to end up with decades in a US jail
 its been hacked and person doing it nor been arrested 5 times
 cblair91: Seems like Alex is trying to say fuck off in a nicer way ;)
 xD'.
 cblair91: look it up, Gary McKinnon
 is he the guy who hacked into pentagon to find ufo lifewstyles and got transfered to us for trial?
 He's fighting extradition, and has lost at every appeal
 yup, thats the one
 The best he can hope for is time in a UK jail
 And that doesn't seem likely
 well
 And what you're talking about involves making something publicly visible
 And then linking it directly with Zymic
 you hear about the terroist who got free from scottish jail because he had cance?
 cancer*
 Yes, the Libyan who has three months to live
 yup
 heard of jonathan johnes
 james*
 one of the world best and most feared hackers
 i
 oops
 Jonathan James: James gained notoriety when he became the first juvenile to be sent to prison for hacking. He was sentenced at 16 years old. In an anonymous PBS interview, he professes, "I was just looking around, playing around. What was fun for me was a challenge to see what I could pull off." 
 want to hear the better part
 no
 James's major intrusions targeted high-profile organizations. He installed a backdoor into a Defense Threat Reduction Agency server. The DTRA is an agency of the Department of Defense charged with reducing the threat to the U.S. and its allies from nuclear, biological, chemical, conventional and special weapons. The backdoor he created enabled him to view sensitive emails and capture employee usernames and passwords.
 nobody cares at this point
 lol
 *knock knock*, whos there "can you give me a password and username", shure
 Would be a lot easier if you just linked us, so that we had a choice ;)
 though, i must admit
 i did lie, mr. james is not best hacker
 STOP TALKING
 lol

 I don't honestly care :)
 oooo, you shall
 nope
 i need some buiscuits

 HOMG - its michael jackson's birthday
 Its sad when they talk to themselves, eh Ben?
 haha xD
 yeh
 Oracle
 lair91
 u forgot the CB
 yes
 why/
 you forgot the "The"
 :)
 actualy
 you should only miss the C
 I don't care really
 because Blair is the surname, thus you missed out the first name C
 and therefore, your THE is your first name, thus. you should miss my first name as i only miss yours
 Wow.
 TheOracle, are you a real oracle?
 Do you honestly think I care about specifics like that?
 what you doing ben :O
 he is watching a tutorial on how to wire a plug
 Im looking for "Ghost Installer Studio" on a certain forum (they begin with "W" and end in "Z") because Ed lied to me =[
 warez?
 ...
 http://warez.com
 could that be it ben?
 Yes, thanks for announcing that to the world lair
 huh?
 If I'm correct we're not supposed to link to warez ;)
 are we not
 Ben wasn't
 you just did
 It's no huge deal while it's not in full swing, Ben.  I get advance warning of migraines is all, the "aura" as it's known :p
 ohh, i did not see it in the rules?
 sorry
 At the moment, provided my head doesn't move much, it's basically business as normal
 i will go read the rules again
 ahh ok Alex, hope it doesn't get to bad :D
 Don't know, I'm planning on going to Bristol later, so I've gone for painkillers plus sumatriptan
 Which I haven't done before, though I'm allowed to take both
 Anyone's guess how it ends up ;)
 Never heard of sumatriptan
 haha xD
 Well, you get it by prescription, so I don't know that you would have
 ahh ok
 anyone got link for IRC rules about W_ _ _ z
 Weedy pain then if plain ibuprofen does it ;)
 cblair91_reading_rules: rules, number four.
 Under "illegal discussion"
 @ http://www.alex-elliott.co.uk/rules/
 im looking at rules
 In turn I haven't heard of co-dydramol, Ben :p
 ibuprofen doesn't work Alex, well not noticeable to me anyway. The Co-Dydramol works a bit.
 alex
 have you a link?
 ...
 liar I just linked to it
 wait hold on
 lair*
 cblair91_reading_rules: TheOracle just linked it and I said where it was in that document
 if illegal discussion results in a kickban
 sBot shoud be kickedbanned
 for trying to crack into my pc ;)
 thanks
 Think its the same as co-codamol Alex
 ajjj
 ahhh*
 Ah, right, similar strength to Codeine+Paracetemol/Ibuprofen
 Anyone got a RS account I can borrow? :p
 Runescape? ;)
 alex, the tablet you took for your migrain
 what was the strength?
 haha Ben
 The painkillers were Paracetemol+Codeine
 Rapidshare
 lol
 yes alex, what was the strength
 It's a capital 'A' cblair91 ;)
 :p
 Alex, what was the strength
 Fedora 11 is nice.
 hurry the hell up with these updates D:
 what updates?
 432 lol
 huh/
 well, I did choose all 3 starting packages on the install
 brb, relog
 *sigh* Will you do us a favour and stay away a bit longer DarkKrai
 erm, how did sBot do that?
 I'm not sure to be honest with you, I could give the volumes
 shure Alex
 16mg codeine, 1g paracetemol
 1mg paracetemol?
 or 1g
 No, 1g
 1mg would be useless :p
 wow
 Typically they come in 500mg tablets
 1000mg
 ahh
 you took 2 tablets
 Yes
 wow
 the adverage recomended dose is up to 750mg at one time
 Like with most painkillers
 yes, 1 or 2
 hmm
 and alex, why did you state the word "adult"
 I made a window Ben :D http://grab.by/2vn with only 4 lines of wxCode http://grab.by/2vo
 as if you were sugesting i was not?
 I wasn't, I'm just saying that I am ;)
 yes, we know you are
 And so that dosage information applies to me
 1. your age is on forums, correct
 Whooooo nice TheOracle :D
 I was possibly unnecessary
 2. you would not be a admin under 18, corect
 But I was basically just reeling of the relevant information
 And part of that is that it's the adult dose :p
 ok
 well
 did you know
 cblair91 you don't have to be over 18 to be an admin :P
 sitting watching a pc screenw while having a migrain or headace makes it worse
 and ben, most comany's do the polcay of over 18 only
 Depends on the trigger of the migraine
 For some people it does, that's true
 alex, some sould be edited to most
 did you know: sharks only attack you when you're wet
 Perhaps, but mine aren't related to visual cues that much.
 ahh
 how did jack and crazymik3 join 3 seconds between each other

 cblair91: If I have to ignore you I won't remove that ban
 Who is that person? :S
 Old user? Seems to know who Toast is.
 Either that or he's making fun of Bread
 Which is dangerous around here
 haha yeh
 Let me know if he's being annoying, I'll reset it
 robert
 that was a mute yeh ?
 why would i be making fun of bread?
 Yep
 i dont see how me at all mentionint toast involved bread?
 He's on my ignore list, so I won't know if he's being annoying
 ahh ok
 Should be able to
 ben
 Try on me
 It won't work :p
 ask robert 'how was me mentoioning toast involve bread'
 "- Halfops cannot set mode q"
 cblair91: No, he doesn't want to talk to you for a reason ;)

    /mode #zymic +b ~q:Ben
 Im asking Robert the command for muting specific users
 use /mode #zymic +b *!*@MY HOST
 Ty
 Whoooo :)
 It's useful, far better than a full ban
 In most cases

 You get to give a reason straight away

 I did it!
 Did what? :D
 HOMG
 why everyone insulting me?
 http://grab.by/2vT
 its stopped responding due to some threading error but it works :D
 lol
 crashed
 yes, the bot is still working
 only the GUI crashed
 Cblair91: Not responding doesn't mean it has crashed
 so it must be a threading issue
 usualy does with vista
 its windows 7
 not vista :)
 looks like vista
 ofc
 you got windows 7 :D
 it still in BETA ?
 but you can't blame the OS on this
 its just some of my bad threading
 I dont think it is
 i think its windows, lol
 its not :/
 lol
 It's beacuse the operation isn't asynchronous, meaning that while the operation is being processed the application blocks the user.
 ool
 cool*
 Ben: ?
 it updates whenever something is printed to >> stderr
 Just telling Cblair91 it doesn't mean it has crashed when it says "Not responding"
 ah
 simply, the program doesnt give a shit
 lol
 lol yeh xD
 well, I wonder what the thread's problem is >:/
 Put the code on a different thread
 what is the program ment to be?
 it should be Ben
 The GUI is on a separate thread than pyDelphi
 atleast I'm pretty sure
 threading.Thread(target=pydui_run())
 hmm
 I could potentially try and launch pydelphi as a new thread from pydui.py
 brb guise, booting into windows
 You mean we have to have you back DarkKrai?
 how are you updating the text on the GUI thread ?
 with print statements
 anything that pyDelphi tries to print to a normal console window is sent to pydui.cntxt instead
 ahh ok, I don't know python (is that what your using?) so not sure if the same rules apply to it as c#
 cntxt being the TextCtrl object
 well kinda
 I'm using wxPython for the GUI
 and wxPython has roots in C++
 but with c# to update text on a label from another thread I use Invoking etc..
 how does sBot do that random chat
 he only does it around darkkrai
 Cblair91 it trigers when a user says "Bye", "brb", "night" etc...
 brb
 Having a break Cblair91? Don't forget your kit kat

 Sazzad, I'm a mathematician
 If that helps
 public enemies D:
 Seen yes man, fight club, and public enemies
 inglorious bastards!
 But never watched I'm a mathematician. 
 Seen that too Dolleh. Pretty good movie. Love Brad Pit as an Italian
 D: damn I wanna see it!
 lovely bones?

 the lovely bones*
 Never seen it
 ffs
 young girl dies, maybe bit boring
 looks like nice graphics tho
 LOL
 Thinking of watching a comedy
 The Hangover
 Seen it
 the hangover, awesome movie :D
 Great movie!
 District 9 was great too!
 how to be a serial killer?
 district 9, gah you seen everything D:
 Do not dare say Bruno
 I SAW BRUNO
 Sazzad	Anyone here an Engineering student or an engineer? < I was replying to that...
 I couldn't stay through the whole movie
 Robert - Oh
 Lol
 I'm not sure if you can help me with my problem. It's related to failure mechanics
 Try me
 just look at creme, hes a great example of failure
 I did applied maths?
 What level is this at?
 It's in mechanical engineering. It's beyond differential equations and matricies
 So you have Calc A, B, C, D, then Differential equations, then matricies, then some engineering courses, then finally Failure Mechanics and calculating points at which a material will break or fail
 I'm definately OK up to matricies
 Ah cool.
 w00 my java irc client works
 er yay...
 im makin irc client DarkKrai
 :D
 WOW
 lol
 whats it called?
 no name yet TheOracle
 I'm just trying to make it work :P
 For the record Bill Bailey's latest tour is awesome, a return to form after Tinselworm I feel
 but theres an instance of it online atm
 ./whois Pie``client
 :o you just been Alex?
 I have indeed
 Awesome!
 Last date of the tour, it was :p
 ;O
 Lucky sod ;)
 Had some interesting points
 I've always wanted to go to a bill bailey tour
 Since it was the last day, Bill's set crew put superglue on one of the screens :p
 He got free in the end, but it wasn't dignified ;)
 This is one of the ones around the edge of the set, so he got his foot glued to it
 hahaha
 I bet he was thrilled
 He didn't seem that bothered :p
 Take the shoe off?
 No, he got the shoe off it, but fell over backwards as a result :p
 Haha brilliant.. sounds like you went on the right night!
 Pie`: if you get the chance, you should go
 I'm gonna D;
 Live stand-up when you're there is awesome stuff
 The DVDs are funny, being in the crowd is better :p
 http://twitter.com/tmdvs/status/3633860737
 who wants to do a bit of it?
 Pie` can I demo your client? I'm quite bored atm
 There isn't much to it
 it doesn't even reply to pings yet
 there's numerous errors
 o_O
 But I'll give you the source if you want it :D
 nah
 Holy shit!
 A friend just added me on facebook
 G'night zymics
 I've not seen him for about 7 years
 Jack, are you busy?
 Very.
 Sup Pie`
 Still using my COD4 license, ay? ;)
 ;)

 but nonetheless, still usin it
 !seen Juw
 Juw was last seen here 7 days, 10 hours, 42 minutes ago.
 :O
 Hai
 hurray!
 whats that :O
 my IRC Client
 i should rlly put it in #test
 ooh nice, written in what lang ?
 java
 sweet
 what toolkit are you using?
 Pie`: is a bell.
 Brandon?
 Ding dong.
 Pie` ?
 What do you mean by toolkit ?
 That you design your gui in like Netbeans, or are you coding it.
 lulz
 Netbeans, ay? ;o
 I used netbeans for the gui
 but using eclipse for programming it
 Ahh ok
 Ben: Java has its own GUI libraries, you don't need third party toolkits for that :p
 Swing and AWT
 Yeh was just wondering what he was using though.
 :P
 Dolleh, why is your dp of some half naked women? :/
 thats left eye brandon XD
 fine i'll change it!
 No leave it Dolleh!!!
 Wait!! Why aren't you at work T_T
 its SUNDAY D=
 or so I hope
 if not, them i'm fucked
 hmmm
 It would be something of a shock if it wasn't
 Hokay Ill let you off for today :)
 WOO :D
 just a lil shock Alex ;)
 gawd sundays are awesome
 +1
 Yay, no work tomorrow :)
 Brandon are you staying on at college?
 No?
 Why would I go college if I have a full time job? :p
 I agree^
 Didn't know you had a full time job :P
 happy now brandon? now DP pic is changed >D
 jelly ftw ben :D
 DOWN WITH TOAST
 Change it back Dolleh now!!
 ^
 Dolleh?
 D: but but but ben!
 That's called "JAM" xD.
 HOMG Dolleh mum called the hospital today, they told me to eat toast!
 O<
 tho I think I have an idea why they tell you so
 I know people who've done it, Brandon ;)
 Strange people :P
 But to be fair, the people I knew tended to have jobs like being a taxi driver
 And wanted to get into something better
 Oh, wait.. what are we talking about?
 The jam/jelly or the job? haha
 The job, replying to what you said about jam would make no sense
 The context doesn't work
 haha
 I guess I could still go college as long as I finished around 0300/0315 to be ready for work at 04004
 0400*
 I used to go to college AND work at the same time, I had no idea what sleep was :D
 so you was an Ed :O
 yeah D:
 She's a 'tom boy' :p
 Dolleh did you show Ed his cat ?
 no he wasnt on no more
 the lazy ass
 Superhuman touch lalalala :)
 0300?  As in 3am?
 What kind of college finishes then :p
 Opps xD
 Dam =[
 1500 :p
 haha Alex
 Forgot about that, gosh =(
 Private combat training can finish around that time, Alex. :)
 Interesting, don't think my college did that course
 Heh, okay.. not a college but it's a course :p
 Alex went to college :O
 Obviously? :S
 could have done 6th form..
 Could have, but didn't :p
 I went 6th form and college xD.
 bleh its way too cold outside ;_;
 thnx brandon, i'm not cold anymore now
 :)
 needed to cut my hair anyway, so win win situation!
 damn Dolleh you're on fire tonight
 yeah man
 Anyone watch x-factor last night ?
 No, I have standards
 TV is boring.
 urgh, the x- factor here is HORRIBLE
 hah, I must agree with brandon :O
 last time I really watched tv was januari lol
 :O It was funny some guy was on stage singing and he hade some huuuuuuuuuuuge bulge in the region of the lower part of the body ;)  Everyon was laughing and he got comments like "I don't think you quite have the full package"
 The music channels are good Brandon
 There's some decent stuff, Mock the Week is on at the moment
 ChanelAKA (previously ChannelU) :)
 Music channels > Mock the week tbh ;)
 If you don't understand the jokes, yes ;)
 I understand the jokes ;)
 I find that hard to believe given your previous statement I'm afraid
 why? :S
 You think music channels are more interesting :p
 Which is clearly insanity
 Ok, well I liek Mock the week and others like it. But Music channels are the next best thing on tv!
 Hah n insanity ;)
 Friday night project?
 Music channels aren't the best channels.. ;)
 hmm stormy weather grr, I should wear my chaps, and I cant find them D: horror!
 Dave <3
 I asked Dolleh if she would do a pixel image thing of my penis and she said no =( Bully, much?
 Yeh geeze Dolleh, how hard is it to do 5 pixels? ;)

 Just like masturbation.
 Sync` Grow up.

 I think that was planned aswell, I mean the main girl aswell :p
 Bleh, why wont my menu items do anything :<
 For what?
 http://pastebin.com/m4adc5f3e
 click the item, it does nothing
 :L
 Done it wrong
 "dix" should be a capital ;)
 it just takes me to http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/javax/swing/JMenuItem.html
 yeah, cause a String would stop it working ;)
 the first item
 Ben, thats because you clicked it :d
 <Pie`>click the item, it does nothing
 You said to :s
 nonon, on the applet itself
 oh
 theres a menubar across the top, with the menus "File" and "Help"
 under the file menu there is an option, "Connet"
 connect *
 that code on pastebin is supposed to output the string when clicked
 but it doesn't.
 http://grab.by/2yr
 yeah, that code >_>
 I've got a picture as an example
 When page loads I'll give you the url :p
 k
 http://img16.imageshack.us/img16/8173/ircd.png
 where is the applet ?
 that is the applet
 once you click connect
 its supposed to write "dix" to the JTextField
 but it doesn't
 no like a link for me to it
 I can give you the source code
 but i don't see how it would help
 as all the code you need you already had
 have *
 Nah its ok thanks, I don't have Java installed =[
 You should :p
 My mate in work does java and 3d rendering stuff :p
 Heh
 I want his bike.. Ninja =(
 ;o
 it's a day, c u's after a bit
 rofl
 Awesome, Ben.
 Alex say my application gave the option for a user to create a new account; each account having settings. If I wanted to store this information easily would a 3 dimensional array be good for this? Information like this: http://grab.by/2ys
 Brandon ?
 Watching 'Rowing worl....' ;)
 Ben, where would the accounts be stored?
 I think he' away Ben, hasn't replied to me yet.
 ahh ok, yeh Rowing is sick!! :D
 Ben, three dimensional?  Where's the third one
 I was being sarcastic when I said 'Awesome' though xD
 isnt it a 2dimensional? :d
 What are you making, Ben?
 Pie` in a Specialized String Collection
 itd be 3dimensional if it went somevalue1 => account name1 => settings, account name 2 => settings, somevalue2 => account name1 => settings... etc
 Im asking whats best Alex
 Brandon: I'm recoding WinUp, don't want to use xml files anymore.
 Are we talking about run-time data storage, or saved profiles
 run-time
 Unless there's somethign you haven't mentioned then it looks like a 2D array would suffice, you could make accounts into an object if you want built-in data validation for a bit more data integrity
 And then have a 1d array of those objects
 Oh ok, thanks.
 Given there's a small number of them, and there's no real complex operations required it should have a negligible effect on performance
 Something* :P
 Alex: do you know what the point in the static final long serialVersionUID is for
 in java classes that extend another
 You'd assume it contains the version of Java the class is from or something
 Just from the name
 Because eclipse suggests adding one
 so i just let it auto-generate one for me :P
 always comes out with something like, 1049385637630437112L
 I don't really know, I don't like Java ;)
 Heh.
 He prefers obj-c ;)
 Noob. :P
 ?
 :rage: why won't my menu item do anyhting >_>
 Alex see that, he called you a noob :O
 I would expect nothing else from someone crazy enough to think Java is worthwhile ;).
 For the record, Obj-C is worse :p
 haha
 haha there aer 5 toms and 2 james in the mens rowing 8 xD
 After Sazzad coded this; http://sazzadhossain.org/portfolio/crown/ .. he made it look poop :(

 GTFO TEH WEB STAN
 woke up; but if he has ever been a boy. Diligence and attention soon gave him the knack of it, and she would throw herself him,
 Do we really need another bot in here?
 hehe
 would it work if i got all the bytes form a submitted image in php, inserted that into a sql field
 no dave I'm just amusing myself ;)
 Stan sucks
 hates anything else, and I've GOT to do it, if he has ever been a great sigh as she brought song and sunshine in at window,
 and then to reverse that sent the data as a header
 im just waiting for help on the hosting chat side
 would that work ?
 too much channel clutter
 Pie`: Possibly...
 can you use different channel please TheOracle 
 LOL hear this dude, he went out with this chick, then crashed over her place, she went to bed and fell asleep, he went clean her whole room o.O WTF

 Dolleh 'clean her whole room' literally? Or 'clean out' her whole room?
 clean it! like, a maid supposed to do! instead of jumping in bed with the chick he start cleaning!?!?!
 Well, if she fell asleep that's not possible
 I admit that cleaning would neccessarily be next on my list...
 But it depends on the room and how messy it was :p

 It's hellish complicated...
 So I'm promising nothing
 Not helped by the server set up I currently have!
 You really don't have to, Robert.

 <3
 ugh
 im not sure how im supposed to a read an outputted string from the irc server without printing it
 >_>
 print it
 but i can't
 because i'm trying to format it
 Unless im trying to fire the event from the wrong place
 heh :p
 Im off, cya later <3 Dave
 hehehehehe i did it
 the reason i couldn't do it that way i was was because i was trying to read from an inputStream that hadn't been started yet
 so all i needed to do was move the place where the event was being fired from
 to the socket class doing the reading, then call the fireEvent method from the socket class
 this si going to make m job easier :D
 that's a wrap, c u's aftera bit

 i think i like one but not sure
 0
 :(
 dont like?
 The Coheed and Cambria concert in Buffalo, NY was GREAT!
 cool
 email Alex
 Sazzad: **
 I don't really like Coheed
 singer is a bit of a girl :p
 haha really sazzad?
 last time i saw them they sucked live lol 
 Yup
 They were great!
 where they headlining?
 or opening?
 Although the acoustic version of Welcome Home wasn't that great
 Headline
 ah that's why
 they were opening for lp when i saw them
 They're too good now for doing openings
 most bands sound like crap when they open for someone
 because the sound guys usually just eq for the headling band
 Most, but when Montey Are I opened for Sum41, they were great.
 I actually enjoyed Montey Are I more than Sum41 that night
 they prob had there own sound guy
 LOL Maybe. Or maybe because I got to meet the band after the show since the lead singer knew my roommates sister. :-D
 nice :D
 we need to find a sound guy for the 21st..
 What's the link to your bands site?
 www.myspace.com/nascentdescent
 anyone else having ftp problems =/
 need to get some more tracks on ther
 I like the guitar
 Although it is a strange start (no offense). Maybe adding a little transition might help
 yeah it kinda just starts
 but a lot of songs do honestly
 I've noticed that.
 Whose the singer?
 and adding an intro on that track atleast would make the vocals come in like over a minutre into the song
 our drummer and other guitarest
 What do you play?
 Oh guitar
 rhythm guitar
 i think the thing we are most proud of is that our music is original, it doesn't really sound like anything on the radio ;D
 You a note reader or string spotter?
 Do you read notes you write down or just plot the cords
 it just depends
 i didnt no any music theory when i started playing
 but i have picked up a fair amount over the last year or so
 but for the most part we just play wat sounds good and then if we have to write it out we tab it and i just write out the rhythms
 none of our music has really been planned out, just doodles we put together
 I like bran flakes :)
 Whats that Sazzad ?
 just waiting for Jack to hook me up with some banners so i can advertise yas :P
 Exactly as it sounds. Going around and searching for spam accounts on the server.
 Gaddar: It's ok thanks, Im going to reformat after iv sorted this project out anyway. Win 7 FTW!
 Oh spam, you said span.
 Zymic servers or your server ?
 I'm getting mine in a month. Looking forward to it. 6gb ddr2, quad core, 1tb harddrive
 lol need any help with that Sazzad?
 Oooh nice Sazzad!
 Oh wait damn, that's the one that got sold out. Here's the other one I'm interested in
 AMD Athlon X2 7750+ dual-core processor; 6GB DDR2 memory; DL DVD±RW/CD-RW drive; Labelflash support; 640GB hard drive; 
 SOunds good, how much that costing you ?
 why do you need 6 gigs of ram?
 why not?
 you running 64 bit?
 because you can only use 3 on 32 bit os
 so if it costs more to get 6 and you're going to run 32 bit its not worth the money
 lol i know that...
 Run linux ;)
 well then dont ask stupid questions :D
 lol i didnt ask a question
 <DJ-JaXm> why not?
 I wanted the quad-core real bad. $800 for the tower + $90 Logitech G15 Gaming Keyboard with LCD Display + $200 24" LCD.
 its common knowledge with pc geeks... even if you cant use it to its max... still great to stretech your e-penis by saying you have 6gb
 true ^ lol
 ;)
 I need all the ram I can get for CAD, software development, graphic development. I run too much crap on my computer at the same time
 hence why it wasnt really a question lolol
 sazzad wat os?
 Windows 7 and most probably Fedora
 nice
 i need to get windows 7.. lol
 i just need a good pc :(
 i hate being poor
 Well if you buy any new towers now, you get free upgrade to Windows 7
 nice
 i love my pc just not my os lol
 Vista?
 Adam :D
 na xp
 DJ-JaXm : I'm not really a PC geek. I just need it for school and work .. lol
 what are your guys views on WinBorg?
 once windows 7 comes out ill probably partion to mac os windows 7 and maybe linux
 lol fair enough :P
 Someone tell Frank, next time I see him. I'm gonna shoot him.
 :P
 aha
 Frank next time adam see's you he's going to shoot you.
 Adam like my work ? :)
 kdigennaro.. that was stupid?
 :D
 :S
 He isn't here :/
 omfg... this guy is talking to me like im an idiot... ive been running radio stations for years -_-

 what losers
 I could be sleeping
 haha
 pwnt
 Cannot believe thta
 I am not even on call tonight
 They just want to be tools
 Tell them your drunk and can't drive
 :O
 Genious
 haha
 "Luke, I realised I am maggot as all shit and I can't drive."
 bwhaha
 "You have about 20 minutes to fix this or I will schelude a meeting for 7am on Monday" :(
 pwnt again
 lol what, can he even do that if your not on call ?
 Dominic and Ryan didn't answer
 So he rang me
 Someone rang him and told him the devsvr fell over
 So I am meant to fix it
 Even though I am meant to be asleep
 I am about to kill someone
 I hate doing this
 ew IIS
 pie`: I will hit you with IIS if your not ssshhh
 IIS sucks bawls :p
 are you opposing that statement ? D:
 No, I just don't need you stating the obvious right now
 xd
 Jacob why does it always fall over ? :S
 Because losers mess with config settings
 e.g. changing the max sessions to 3
 Who the fuck does that?
 lol wtf
 There are 11 IT staff
 Do we share sessions or something now?
 One the girls tried copying the wwwroot to their c: drive oncwe
 Pushed the server over hardcore
 I was like "why?
 hahaha
 Why in your right mind would you copy 60gb of test scripts/data/etc.
 sell ?
 to steal 'em
 No good to anyone else
 We built it for our custom platform
 quriousity then
 Lol
 They have access to it
 curiosity
 it has to be,
 she'll take it back home and study it till the dawn
 or jsut prue idiocy
 or she has no idea what's going on
 hmm
 i tihnk theres a storm brewin
 I will go with option B
 its got really dark n windy
 did you ask her?
 Yes
 and the answer was...
 And she said, "What do you mean the c: drive?"
 :D
 who the hell is she?
 it?
 According to her email signature, "Graphics/Multimedia Advisor - gotalk limited"
 now, that figures the obvious lack of computer knowledge, but now a new question has arisen...
 And your answer is
 why the hell would she be even touching that server...
 She needs the .tpl files
 It is not good enough I email them to her
 She *must* have the update to date version
 my god, what kind of a monkey business are you guys running over there...
 Gaddar: I could be the CEO
 why in the earth does she have access to the server directly... i mean the drive..
 couldnt you use a versioning system?
 svn :D
 There is one
 I get a weekly listing
 run a crontab every hour or so on each users pc
 Jacob how long would it take me to download and install sp2 on xp ?
 whcih tries to update the required files
 so why does she even have access to the drive, directly
 Ben: installing sp2 takes like 15 minutes on a sata HDD
 idk 'bout download
 !usr @desvr2 'webPartsTemplates' - 7days
 Gaddar: She whinged to the Department Manager so I had no option
 Oh ok cheers Pie`, thinking of it I dont think my xp can be updated. Ill wait for TheOracle
 Ben: get sp3
 it boots waaaaaaay faster
 I would had said "fuck off - busy"
 I will after, I just need to check this app runs on sp2 though for sure.
 hmm now to look for my desktop..
 Gaddar: I am going to force that SVN system on her
 IT have MOSS 2007 so it's all good for us
 best choice imho
 And we are idiots
 aren't
 Windows Live photo gallery makes great panoramas
 much quicker than photoshop too
 Gaddar: I am so pissed about this job
 It started off good
 It is slowly pissing me off
 http://i32.tinypic.com/1f8lu9.jpg
 woo~
 Nice, you rich basket =[
 Jacob: most jobs tend to end up the same way. But nothing beats working with the wrong people.
 Gaddar: Marketing are fucking idiots
 No matter how much I tell them I have better things to do; they keep coming back
 useless managers, and marketing guys, i was about to say.
 Not too bad at all Lenny
 "but this will just take a second"...."mate, I do not have time right now. People do not have access to the CRM. Come back after all is up again"
 Jacob: at my last job, i was maintaining the web site on which credit card transactions pass, debugging POS software, regularly monitoring oracle and custom built application servers.
 and i was doing all this literally at the same time
 meanwhile, of course, i was being forced to insert sql updates manually at least 10 times an hour.
 :P
 just because a dumb ass sales person messed some stuff up.
 and you can't say no.
 Just drives me stupid
 I need this done NOW
 Nope. Not going to happen. I am on lunch
 lol
 Jacob, this is in no way an exaggeration:
 i spesifically remember my manager getting pissed of at me, just because i said to her:
 "hold on 5 minutes, i have to restart oracle, and the database servers; the client sessions crashed the app server and it flooded oracle"
 * "oracle and the app servers"
 Afternoon all :)
 I amm off
 It is getting cold and early
 And I have to deal with more shit today
 cya

 No Drazilaustin, I was just checking the link
 mornign robert
 old f5
 hold*
 It says F2
 soon as it goes to black screen, hold f5
 try the f5
 if not work, do f11 nd f12
 It has a boot disk in it, how is it getting to windows?
 erm
 you have boot disks in
 ohhh, hold f7
 on start-up hold f7
 Delete is the one I usually use, though if yours says F2, F2 it is.
 USB keyboard Robert?
 I really should stop doing what you say Cblair91
 No, integral
 why robert?
 lol
 Well, none of it's worked so far
 on a typical pc, f7 on bios startup means load from boot disk
 No Ed, not delete
 I know it has a bios, it has a bios pass set
 try f7, that usualy does load from boot disk
 Hmm, which bios is it Robert, or is it masked by the companies boot screen?
 Masked
 *company's
 Dell?
 I get a toshiba screen for about 2 seconds with a message saying f2 for boot selection
 Then a password screen
 Then straight into ME's loading screen
 I may just format it, I wonder if DOS will let me...
 lol
 try loading a second-os
 you could just clean the MBR
 MBR?
 master boot record
 It's what defines where the computer should boot to, if that's cleared it won't boot to windows
 And how would I do that?
 through DOS
 Yeah, through cmd window, I think it's fdisk /mbr in windows too... but one sec, what's the model of the PC / laptiop?
 toshiba
 he said
 Yes, but that's manufacturer, not the model.
 ahh
 Cblair91, :(
 Pardon asking the obvious, but have you tried hitting escape on the boot screen rob?

 wtf is the word
 That's an acronym
 ty
 does it count as 1 word?
 or 3 letters?
 it is an akronym for 3 wrods
 but is it counted as 3 letters or 1 word
 in the form of WTF
 Wtf at the email? 
 ^
 yes, wtf at the email
 Cblair91 I think you have explaning to do...
 Honestly, why would someone reply with that. 
 And why would anyone hire Cblair91 
 :P
 i honestly have no mind?
 i will ask him when he next comes on

 what has matt replied by any chance?
 *cough* capital *cough*
 jack has no capital for me
 lol
 :O HOMG
 he is just, jack
 he will ignore you now I tell you!
 or i can call him ~
 yes, i bet he might
 he is joining this chat
 He probably is in here
 Well done
 lets have luck
 waiting, waiting an more waiting
 he is DC
 so jack, where is this matt
 :o
 Matthew?
 I guess that would be him 
 It does seem Jack is telling the truth.
 I don't see any reason why he would lie?
 Being the owner of Zymic and sever other companies, it woulnd't suit his reputation to be known as untruthful.
 several*
 yeh :p
 :P
 As for motivation, I would be upset if someone left my project, especially someone who did as much as Chris claimed to have done.
 :O
 We can assure you, Chris has never been a Zymic staff member. We find it quite surprising he didn't think about the repercussions of claiming that he did.
 oh look, he's back under a new name
 Now he quit
 -_-
 I see that now. So he was just a user of your service that dreamed big?
 Yeah :P
 Correct, I'm kind of curious what was going through his mind when he sent you that email. But he has never been a staff member, and most likely never will after what has happened.
 Pretty much it, he's not been around that long either.
 Oh he's been chatting to me for weeks
 bit of a cock too, really
 :P
 Said he co-founded with Jack.
 Led me through various supposed discussions he had with you guys
 I don't think he's even old enough to have co-founded it with Jack :p
 Wow
 He co founded zymic
 Supposedly I was going to be able to use some of your server space for cheap or something...
 Eesh, Jack and his cousin started Zymic over 5 years ago. A* BS.
 in his dreama
 According to his story, he also gave you guys over $7000 in financing
 :O
 That is a total lie right there
 I was pretty sure he was lying for most of the time.
 But then, I mailed Jack.
 And all his reply said was
 "No he doesn't work for us, he is just frequently visits our chat network and talks to users and staff."
 Which sums it up pretty nicely.
 :P
 Yep, but if he had just quit it would still have been true.
 I can't imagine he's got that money to donate, to make an estimation I'd put him around the 15 / 16 y/o mark.
 I mean Jack has been paying for like everything out of his pocket and he still provides almost everything for free.
 I assume the 91 in his name implies he is (or nearly is) 18, Ed ?
 :P
 Ah, quite possibly :-p
 Could all be a faÃ§ade though
 oooooh ;)
 I just wanted to be absolutely sure it was him who was lying and not you guys.
 Show off :p
 ROFl
 Trust me a big compan like Zymic wouldnt lie.
 company*
 Oh there he is
 Hey Chris
 dr_tooth, why don't you just come on as your normal nick. It's pretty obvious it's you and you're hiding.
 ^
 Yeah, it's a good thing you did follow it up IsMyWebsite 
 He should be banned
 I think he owes Jack and Matthew an apology first.
 Yup
 Seems he's not mature enough for that though.
 WTF http://grab.by/2Np

 Does anyone know if it is technically possible to encrypt keys typed from a keyboard?
 "keyboard SSL" to so speak ;)
 lol
 nfi
 Ed
 Alex
 ?
 Would have to be hardware based & a separate keyboard driver I would imagine
 Trying to stop them intercept at what level?
 Think I'm on to my next HMA venture ;)
 Well gp
 Software 
 http://www.halfbakery.com/idea/Secure_20USB_20keyboard
 Heh
 Dave: :)
 Heya
 Hey all.
 Interesting idea Jack
 No progress since 03
 :|
 Jack - what do you mean by "encryp keys typed from the keyboard"?
 You mean encrypt as it's being type?
 Typed*.
 Well
 I'm not sure but a way in which it is impossible to intercept
 key strokes
 I think the problem would be the applications getting the actual input, if someone wanted to intercept it, they can most probably just inject the application and crack it so it has a routine to swipe them at that level.
 True
 One thing though, you should try LibertyReserve.com
 Now that's what I call security
 Hey Ed, if you're awake do you have time for a question? People have been pointing me to you all week lol
 You have to use their onscreen keyboard
 You also get various different pin numbers
 Passwords
 Custom welcome messages
 Access alerts etc
 Although its because its used by the mafia
 And for people to launder money
 Basically its an online wallet
 You can only fund by using another exchange
 Which is why its located in Costa Rica ;)
 hey all
 But very good site
 h TheOracle
 hello Jack
 TO :D
 hey Dolleh
 If you use a remote desktop are the keys still intercepted the same as if you were using a keyboard hooked up to the machine?
 IS there any difference?
 Dunno
 I would assume that there would be no diff for preventing compatibility issues
 not sure though

 Look at the reviews!!
 According to a quick web search, the sonic toothbrush combines the usual motorised brush action with "turbulent fluid dynamics".
 In short all that saliva and toothpaste sloshes around and scours the plaque off your teeth and can shoot effective cleansing eddies up to 4mm from the brush head, which penetrate BETWEEN the teeth.
 I'm sold!
 Jack... I guarantee I'll give your mouth a better 'workout' than a bloody overpriced electric toothbrush
 man I need an electric toothbrush mouthquard
 hahaha
 just stick the mouthguard in while your still getting ready
 I saw a toothbrush the toehr day
 cost £85
 I'll be rich, who wants to make it with me
 Rofl
 we'll charge (weird crooked L)100 for it
 Andrew, take the idea of a gunshield
 make it a tad wider
               electric toothbrush
 add some minty buffers in the inside of it
 job done? :d

 Sounds like someone's a bit insecure to me :p
 If I ever play you, Ill show you how to really play the game ;)
 You would beat me at the moment, I'm fairly sure.  My gameplay is aimed towards a level of practice I don't have these days
 I would probably have to go for burst-fire roaming unless I got back into it.
 Plus a fair bit of it is knowing the maps
 ugh... ive been djing for 12 hours straight... and i still got a huge audience so cant stop -_-
 Yeh I agree Alex, I played Halo with my friends the other day.. I lost miserably =[
 hah nice JaXm
 Alex you going to buy the new call of duty ?
 Don't know, depends how it performs in wine I guess :p
 I don't really want to get it for a console, I did that before and spent the whole time wishing I had a mouse
 haha you can plug a mouse in though
 in the PS3
 Doesn't mean it'll work
 The PS3 supports the hardware, but the game still has to implement it
 Yeh didn't think of that :/

 How many listeners you got ?
 right now... 10... its been going up and down from 23 - 15 all night... all together tonight ive had 203 unique listeners total
 :O nice, how long have u been going now ?
 iirc evony is a pretty big game
 so if you get adverts on the evony site, itll be sure to bring in a lot of people
 about a month Ben
 yea evony is... im actually signing papers and working on the deal to get sponsoring from evony
 these listeners i got right now are all from like spread word of mouth... plus theres 1 person tuning in for her entire office... about 20 people or something
 ooh sounds good!
 yea... been VERY successfull... when we get advertised with evony, im geuss ill have at least 250,000 hits the first week
 so wait, who told you to make evony radio? Or was it your own choice
 i made it... saw it as a great opportunity
 evony is really big... but also really new... therefore they dont have alot of fan sites already existing
 JaXm Are you the only DJ?
 right now yes :S
 i got another guy lined up... but hes been having net issues.. hes very good, djed with him for years
 im kinda picky when it comes to dj's...they are what makes the station what it is, and i wont have half-assers
 What timezone is he on? :p
 As it'd help if he's not on yours!
 YES A DISCONNECTION
 WOOHOOO
 LOOK AT ME I'M HERE STILL!

 Why is Hotmail shit... :@
 Because microsoft... no way too easy, I'm not going there :P
 haha, their shitt javascript is screwing up for me!!
 I select a couple of emails to delete, select another one and it unticks all ther others iv already selected :@
 Haha, why are you still using hotmail? :P
 Because thats the address everyone has for me and all my mail goes to =[
 Right, time to hit views...
 If i could re-direct it to gmail then i would
 Can you not set up a filter for it?
 Hotmail not allowing redirects is a pain
 Nope :(
 No, they don't allow it
 I have a gmail im going to start using
 They know everyone would leave :p
 Ben - write an app in C++ to redirect
 maybe i could make a program to re-direct all my mail for me.
 haha i don't know C++ though =[
 Can't you access it via pop3?
 Then set it up with a website, sell the service on a per e-mail basis
 Not sure
 Not new accounts
 Ah
 my account is years old
 You can access old accounts, but I mean older than my account old accounts
 Maybe you could setup a script somewhere to act as a forwarder
 SELL IT
 Or rather, sell the service
 Yeh I might have a google later. Robert make it for me? :D
 I'd use it
 Of all the projects I've got for my spare time, it's the best so far
 So yeah :p
 Ed, mind me using the Zymic server for that? :p
 hehe
 I spammed my email once by accident of brandons server xD
 And then route it all via hms
 hma*
 Haha, yeah, probably best not to do with with Zymic as we have to be able to send emails ;)
 No, just the appache requests to hotmail
 Not e-mail spam
 If it were pop3 it would just look like a standard pop3 client
 I'll get them to forward it!
 They don't allow pop3
 haha this sounds like a plan ;)
 I'd log in, forward all e-mail, then delete
 On a 24 hr/less basis
 The only possible problem is requiring JS
 and spoofing browser
 But I can do that... Just have to learn to pretend!
 HOMG I think I found something  http://grab.by/2SR
 http://grab.by/2SQ :O
 Would have to spoof the cookie they set I imagine
 Capturing cookies is hardly a problem
 Nope :P
 Ben, that's the wrong way round
 I imagine that's how they do the test for js
 it is ?
 I don't
 Yeah, route other mail through hotmail
 You want to route hotmail elsewhere
 oh yeh =[ nooooooo
 I imagine they have a non js page set up, then use js to make the proper page
 but it says send and recieve
 So it's unusable other wise
 OTHER email accounts
 not their own
 =[
 I need to get on with work
 Yeah, but the detection has to occur, a cookie or <noscript> tags is really the only ways to detect that, "If cookie is set redirect to js compat page" default page = no javascript enabled.
 I'll have to study the request...
 How long will it take you to make us this script then Ed? :D
 Well you can do the obvious degradation methods like links where if js, return false, otherwise if not, it uses the href field.
 Hah, nice try Ben ;)
 cant blame me for not trying ;)
 I actually think there is a market for this
 i hate my dvd player
 Doesnt want to load

 We're looking for people who are willing to play around with the software to the brink of destruction
 i went to bed at 4:30
 I still feel tired
 and its 12 :P
 Anyone interested?
 What kind of software Sazzad ?

 hi guys
 Hello bharubal 
 just wanna ask how to delete my web host account
 bharubal: Please join #hosting
 XD
 why are java arrays such a whore :<
 Hi Jack2
 Lol
 Ed, Edd and Eddy
 Hey Sazzad 
 ugh I hated that tv show
 i loved it lol
 lolz
 I couldnt stand the little fat one AT ALL
 LOL
 I really enjoyed eddy
 Howdy Ed
 Andrew change your nick to Edd, and I'll change mine to Eddy
 I've never seen it :-p, I get the reference a lot though.
 I'll be the idiotic one
 :D
 wait
 oh I'm the nerd
 I think eddy was the idiotic one
 :-D
 nerd with OCD
 lmao
 Or as eddy would say it 8-B
 to much ed in here D:
 lol
 I think I'll stay like this the whole day
 I'm double D 
 rofl
 lol
 Think for all web surfing activity I'm going to use a remote PC
 Seems the safest way
 Firewall my web browsers and apps
 Sorted imo
 Ed and Edd would you guys be interseted in beta testing the software?
 Demo: http://jorsek.com/videos/commercekit_overview/index.html
 You too Dolleh
 WHA? D:
 Become a beta tester for a software we're going to release soon
 It's a WYSIWYG CMS for the web
 bollocks
 I connected to a vpn on my remote pc
 Now the IP changed of course
 I'm locked out
 of remote access
 haha
 poo
 hmmmm
 time for a reboot :(
 silly Jack :p
 back :D
 People, #hosting now
 It could be about to get amusing...
 We're about to be offered something
 oooh
 Not that amusing, pity
 So I'm going to pirate hidemyass-vpn
 For free advertising
 It won't work of course
 But I'm sure this plan will work muwaha
 haha evil mwhaha
 Well
 It will work
 For a couple of days
 Get people using it
 Then all of a sudden user gets deleted ;)
 And people will go "stuff it, I'll buy"
 haha sounds good!
 You are quite crazy ;)
 back
 reboot worked
 phew
 Dave: <Brandon>Ben.. when Dave is on show him what I have done so far and ask him if I want to carry on with it or not please? :p  http://threedicedrop.com/dave/
 Ahh yeh cheers... I message him already ;)
 *d
 ahh ok ;)
 what you think of it ?
 That's nice
 Text could do with some work but its minor
 tbh he needs to stop working on Ed's and Dave's and work on mine ;)
 Yeh I like it.. especially the spelling error ;)
 Yeh I've told him not to bother for now
 Music Society?
 I haven't got time to do anything
 I like it too, but the text in that box is a tad bad
 Yes ben, it's a new cult
 :D
 hehe
 I thought you was the read Ed then =[
 Just trying to disguise it as a "society of musically people"
 In uni.. you have societies for everything.. you join the one's you are interested in
 *ones
 Wait Edd = Andrew and Eddy = Sazzad ?
 We don't have that here for our universitys
 I'm not Andrew
 who's andrew?
 It's the main thing here
 In UK unis
 he is my lover :o
 You have tennis society, black music society, condom society! literally everything
 haha I personally like the Dave society ;)
 I'll join the rape ben society
 hehe whooooooooooooooooo :D
 It's not as good as the Ben society tho :p
 YAY!! Thats cos Dave and Andrew are in my society :D
 You know like gangs and the mafia use disposable phones
 Use it for one call and lob it away
 To bypass wiretaps
 What about desposable virtual computers?
 lol
 :/
 We have MetroPCS, you don't need a social to get an account, just an ID. Which can be faked pretty easily
 lol Jack you have many new business ideas ;)
 So madia could have the same number for a month
 then just toss it
 Email from Brandon http://grab.by/2TB :/
 unlimited minutes and text and web usage for $50 a month
 Combine with TrueCrypt encrypted OS
 A VPN to the RDA
 So they can't tap into which IP you are accessing
 If I use a portable browser
 Will it still use temporary internet files?
 I believe it has to jack
 I know even mobile browsers do
 It wouldn't have anywhere to save the page as it's loading if it didn't have temporary internet files
 Well I thought it could use the directory its located in
 E.g. on the usb drive
 Oh, well it should do that, but I don't know 
 Would think it would have to
 Just get someone to edit firefox to be portable and to always open under the private browsing mode
 that way the temp files are deleted immediately
 Noo Andrew you changed your name
 Yea I was tired of being double d

 How are you?
 Brandon this isn't funny, I will gline you if you don't drop it.
 :O
 :)
 fukus
 i like your name.
 alguien pasa alguna pÃ¡gina web
 !translate on Fakuus 
 alguien habla espaÃ±ol?
 Fakuus: someone speaks Spanish?
 si
 que tal?
 The bot translates for us
 oh ok
 bien aca
 Fakuus: well here
 That's it, gline time.
 :O
 I've stopped them getting in... go do your thing Ed ;)
 :)
 :O
 What's mode +R?
 bueno chau, aca hablan todos ingles y no los entiendo, disculpenmen pero chau gente, qe pasen bien!!!
 Fakuus: good bye, here all speak English and do not understand, forgive me but people chau, qe nice day!
 Registered only Andrew, or is that +r?
 Fakuus, just ask in spanish
 I need to get a cheat sheet for the modes
 No, +r means it's a registered chan
 beso chau!
 yea
 only server can set +r
 Ed: +R stands for registered nicknames only. As its name implies, only those who are using and have identified to their current nickname (in other words, those who are set to umode +r) are allowed to enter the channel. For informations to umode +r see section section 3.2. 
 http://docs.dal.net/docs/modes.html
 Ah, thanks.
 Did yall really gline Brandon?
 no
 Just his VPS if it was him
 Oh ok
 and that wasn't a gline
 that was just a channel ban
 a gline is a global ban, meaning he wouldn't be able to connect to the server at all
 He can still join all the other channels
 I know :P I have been glined before T_T
 I glined him Andrew 
 oh lmao
 Good job
 Well the Illinois IP address
 :O
 Ok :P
 Nobody from Illinois as a regular either, wonder how he got a server inside of a school

 What number is 10010 in binary
 It is 9
 Slow pokes
 AFK
 122 in base 3
 Wrong
 It's not 9
 101 in base 4
 32 in base 5
 25 in base 6
 23 in base 7
 21 in base 8
 Worked it out yet?
 it is 9 in binary...
 No it's not
 1 - 2 - 4 - 8
 1 + 8 = 9
 Wrong
 wait, did he count 0?
 16:1 8:0 4:0 2:1 1:0
 0 - 1 - 2 - 4 - 8
 16 + 1 = 17
 binary goes left ot right
 wait shit
 no it goes right to left
 No, same way as normal numbers
 there are 10 types of people in this world... those who read binary, and those who dont
 ^
 does that statement actual work though? i dont know binary lol
 yes
 im assuming like 10 is binary for 2?
 that equals out to 2
 because starting from 1 in `headers`
 ok thats what i thought lol... i never got it confirmed though :P
 the table would be going
 2 - 1
 oh dude.. dont even try to explain it
 with 10, you have 1 2 and no 1
 = 2
 just a simple yes or no is all this noob needs to know
 binary is actually really simple ;)
 pfft
 your gonna make my mind explode
 i struggle with basic web design... im more of a manager/promoter

 Tim did you get your snow thing ? :D
 Get the the end of the hedge, have to hop over a gate to get into a track, realise that one dog is with me, the other is in the other field
 I try to call her through, but she's stuck behind sheep neting
 dogs are stupid
 I walk back to where she got through, get into the other field, but by the time I've got to her she's found a way through and is now in the track, the other side of sheep neting
 I walk back and she, realising I'm in the field, has gone back again.
 So we're back to square 1

 well how do you chainge the color of a link that has been visited
 Drazilaustin: Sorry for the late reply. I went to the rest room. You do a:visited { your style here; }
 If you just want that effect on a certain container, just do:   .container_name a:visited { your style here; }

 anyone wanna leave me a review about my website?
 Link
 Is it on the forum JaXm
 no... its on this like Top Evony Websites List
 well gonna kill 2 birds with one stone... http://evonyradio.com -- at the bottom of the page youll see an image right beside the Donate one, click it, brings ya to a new page, we are #6... click Stats, click Rate And Review This Site
 Hello
 please and thanks in advance =]
 itd be good if you of course gave us a great rating... but definetly be honest...
 To be honest, I really don't lie your layout Jaxm. It just doesn't make much of an impact.
 Hey Cr`eme
 I thought I banned your IP
 :O
 beh... thats the way Evony wanted it :S
 Sazzad, D<
 JaXm: I would strongly recommend you create a more radio feeling to your site if you want to make a big impact on your visitors. 
 !ban +b Cr`eme
 :O
 Cr`eme (~Creme@iqbalniazi.uuuq.com) has left #zymic (Sazzad D< FINE)
 how do you mean a more radio feel to it...?
 LOL. You see that Dolleh. THat's how you get rid of Cr`eme
 :D good boy sazzad
 :-D
 JaXm: Take for example: http://www.wadiomedia.org/ When I visit that site, I feel like it's a radio site because of the images and the features they provide (i.e. playlist). But looking at just the top of your site, I feel like it's a World of Warcraft site and I don't feel like looking through the rest of the content.
 sazzad, look in hosting D:
 WOO!
 hmm...
 well those radio sites are just that... a radio website, this website here is themed to a particular audience (Evony)... so it does have to be geared to relate to that website and game
 so with keeping that in mind... what kind of suggestions would you have me do for it?
 I did not know Evony was a game. LOL. SOrry
 lol
 lol who is ddosing vndv
 no probs man... and btw, im not like arguing or anything, im wanting some professional feedback :P
 Try having better styling for fonts and containers. Such as dates next to events, the dates tend to fallout of the calendar container.
 I guess my best suggestion would be to find a font and font-color that is more suiting to the layout.
 yea working on fixing the dates issue...
 Have you considered gearing the entire layout towards something like this: http://www.elegantthemes.com/preview/eBusiness/
 hmm... any suggestions for a font/font color scheme for it?
 It has a similar theme and perhaps you can change somethings around to make it work for you. 
 Comic sans or Courier but not many people like these two font.
 ok
 Sazzad dont be mean to Cr`eme
 lol
 hmm i really dont like that design :S

 Wow 
 Andrew: Why not just make your own.
 :s  EggPlant :O
 Take the image and paste it
 Anyone speak russian here?
 No :P
 Sazzad, isn't it expensive to do that
 For only one shirt
 especially with 7 colors
 Nyeat
 Sazzad, is right you could make it easily :P With like those custom tshirt makers :O
 oh the iron on
 didn't even think of that
 Would have to buy some high quality shirts I like
 I might end up having to do that
 :P
 HTML question, how can I make an inline <span> tag be on it's own line?
 reason I need this is becuse it's inside of a <li> and I need it in there to not mess everything else up
 Isn't there some kind of css tag that does that?
 it's display:block if anyone cared
 thanks for the hlep

 You want the font so you can play with it yourself?
 ill find it on dafont.com
 It's not a free font
 it's an adobe font
 Why don't i have it in photoshop then O_o
 $35 from adobe. http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1724
 Because it's a seperate purchase
 adobe has like 2000 fonts, they don't include them all with photoshop because they are greedy

 Hot coffee ;)

 Hmm, I have to buy an engagement present but haven't a clue what to get... what's the normal?
 Did you google it? xD
 can't be kitchen appliances as they already live together
 Ed, they don't have a registry?
 registry?
 a list of crap they want
 that's normally how it works here across the pond
 they register with some store, and make a list of stuff they need
 oh, no, I'm not sure if they're expecting engagement gifts tbh. The whole thing was only organised yesterday
 Saturday is when it's happening
 SP, you're thinking of wedding gifts I thing
 wedding? weding?
 wedding
 yeah i suppose i am
 shame on you robert :O
 I did go for that in the end, but it didn't look right...
 Why Dolleh?
 but i've never heard of engagement gifts, just wedding gifts
 you should have know how to type that! XD
 :p
 No around here we do what SP said they do :P
 thanks creme
 no probs
 xD
 I'll write a dictionary plugin at some point, just get sBot to check for me Dolleh :p
 Wow
 hehe handy
 Photo frame with their names engraved on it, engagement or wedding gift?
 http://i32.tinypic.com/1zekvus.jpg
 my desktop ;)
 Ed: that is good
 Ed: I'd say weddin
 g
 ^
 either probably ed
 i think of wedding gifts as more fucntional items
 things they need to start a new life together
 Liek a TV
 :P
 They live together already though SP, makes it twice as hard
 I say wedding because with both their names engraved its showing they share things etc. when you're engaged the same rules don't really apply
 If you are not really on a budget. Give them a TV xD
 yo
 Hey Jacob 
 Hmm, could take a pic during the engagement party, then engrave it with their names and the year 
 I need a girlfriend, she could decide all this then xD
 :P
 Yeah, they're useful for that kind of thing...
 Ed has a g/f
 Her name is IRC
 *zxq
 Oh...
 I haven't even taken it out of the rar yet though...
 But cant till nine o clock D:
 Could buy something with a bit of comedy, like a universal remote so they always have a remote each :P
 :P
 Robert: May I see
 hey :P
 Jacob why did you call me earlier ?
 I remember I was meant to do one. :(
 It's still rar'd!
 Lol Ben
 But I can show you the preview, if it's still up
 I was in the bath =[
 Hey kdigennaro 
 That's fine Jacob, I mentioned it to my bro and he said he knew some people who were good at photoshop
 I have just been so busy with work stuff
 http://www.norriswebdesign.co.uk/thatcode/
 Lots of people look please
 So I get lots of different browsers, to find bugs
 Also, comments?
 As it's probably up to me to do any changes from here on in
 I want to change the menus to li's
 Bit of a rough design
 Just don't like the general layout
 ya i keep looking at it too im not sure wat i dont like about it
 but somethings not right
 That face you two buggers aren't getting paid, you jelous plums!!!
 fact* jealous*
 this part here feels off balance, www.sharpielovers.com/images/grabs/yeigy.png
 thers an image on the right but nothing on the left
 brb changin internet
 While you're away Ben, we'll be cracking into your computer.
 You might be right...
 tbh that whole part is going to disappear for a bit
 i think it's salvagable just needs a second look
 I don't always want a submenu
 and why make only the actual link click able?
 That'll be fixed when it goes li
 kk
 Ben's already mentioned it
 gotcha
 i really like the logo and background behind it though
 Bye Bye #zymic

 Boots pharmacy
 heh
 im going to rage at this torrent in a minute
 its downloading stuff at 100kb/s
 and immediatly casting it away :<
 because it thinks its 'rubbish' data
 Total Downloaded: 1.03 GB (493.15 MB rubbish data dropped)
 its only a 518mb torrent D:<
 I vote kdigennaro gets a gline for sending me #nsfw content
 lmao
 kdigennaro:
 I has proof
 :>
 Gojira, interesting choice, Pie`:p
 :D
 i just semi-downloaded the discographu
 discography *
 Found them a bit too heavy without a point to it myself ;)
 missing the end part of 7 songs because bitlord is a homosexual.
 so
 where shoulf I buy a server from?
 servers.com
 :>
 it really depends on what you're looking for Lenny.
 What sort of server are you after Lenny? What's it for?
 It is for hosting several websites
 also, for illegal things
 oh, and for my radio show
 I wouldn't go for a big name host
 liek hostgator or something
 Heh, I don't know of who won't mind you hosting illegal content :P
 Ed, trick is don't tell them you're hosting illegal stuff ;)
 most don't really care what you do to be honest
 Use zymic server ;)
 nah
 Lenny, are you english ?
 does speaking it count?
 In the US iirc
 Unless they get a complaint
 If they do then they make sure you know :p
 Lenny build your own island and host the server there
 And they won't be happy with "well I put it there" ;)
 open waters, anything goes
 ok ok
 so forget the illegal content part
 haha
 now does anyone have any good suggestions?
 But just pretend that someone stole your FTP
 buy a polish server
 And run away
 they're not heavy about laws there
 I should just make my own server
 too bad my connection isn't exactly great
 Buy a windows server ;)
 Lenny, buy a T3 line
 ;))
 ew
 its only $6000->$14000/m
 http://www.speedtest.net/result/556101664.png
 my shit comes out faster than that lenny
 We had this discussion yesterday
 I believe I won on useless upload speed
 good for you, SP
 lol
 Useless?
 0.35
 lol
 last test i managed to get done
 i got 0.02mb/s
 :>
 I haven't been able to do a test since because chroe gives up loading the flasha pp
 cause it takes to long
 Ben, stop trollin'
 :O
 shhh, we don't want to know
 lol
 I get similar while I'm home on upload, Robert
 Well, not here, just pm us :p
 Robert just jealous :P
 I already miss the upload on campus :p
 Yeah, it really is awesome...
 SP, what year of highschool are you in now?
 senior
 good song
 Since I'll be living off campus that precludes using the university for most stuff, but I can still SSH into one of the campus servers if need be I guess
 love this song
 Or actually walk there ;)
 But that's a last resort
 Alex, do you know much about computer hardware?
 or anyone here
 Beyond putting together a desktop, no.
 Jack would probably know about dedicated server hosting
 http://www.speedtest.net/result/556105125.png
 heh i got one done
 :d
 thats fastest ive had in a looooong time
 How do you not ping on this?
 because my internet is very stable
 just slow
 ping timeout only occurs when you loose connection
 or fail to reply to a ping
 and as the ping threshold for this server is about 180seconds
 god damn i'd kill myself if i had that kind of connection
 and actually
 It seems that I need to play 'find the computer' tomorrow
 i think its my network card though
 thats got me slow
 My router is claiming 6 connections
 Me, parents computer, bridge router
 Then I run out
 Especially when it claims an itouch
 We only have 1 as a family, and it's in Scotland
 lmao my dog is histarical
 the fire department and the cops just drove by with lights and sirens on
 and every time she hears a siren she makes the noise lol
 My ping is worse :\ at least my down speeds are bareable. but not with three comptuers in the house, it gets drastically slow sometimes. http://www.speedtest.net/result/556107027.png
 kdigennaro For stupid dogs mine beats you for this morning
 im going to make a recording one day and see how long she does it lol
 but i think my problem is my network card
 Neenaawww
 because a few months back, my mum put in this thing
 which like transported lan packets through the electricity systme in your house
 you plug ths thing into a wall at 1 end and run ethernet cable from router -> it
 l ladies?
 then plug anotehr 1 in near the pc
 and run ethernet cabel from it -> pc
 since that was put in my internet has dropped form 3mb/s
 oh yea, i'm sure that's it
 to that above
 BUT
 and this is a very big but
 shes now removed it again
 and there has been no improvement
 although the rest of the computers in the house still get ~2 - 3mb/s
 How are you hooked up? LAN or WLAN?
 LAN
 wow, get a new card, they are like 10 USD
 im gonna take a stab in the dark and say its fucked up my network card
 or its a dodgy cable
 do yo uknwo fi you need special cards for special mobos
 or are they generic
 'cause if theyre generic ill just rip the one out of my old pc
 generic normally, most nic cards are just PCI cards
 it's generic pci
 Though alot of the times they are built onto the mobo
 i dont think they ar eon either pc
 I wouldn't suggest just ripping it off the mobo lmao :D
 heh no, I'm no noobie at computer hardware
 but im no pro ;)
 you sure?
 'cause ur pretty pro dude
 TROOOOLLLLL
 my opinion isnt a troll..
 NOSKILLS!
 Epic night :).

 EWW
 Acer = Ftw.
 Well yea Acer is awesome
 But Dell...eh...
 ;)
 :p
 their Inspiron laptops that we have at school suck ass
 I think I should get some more server exp from workies. :o
 The wifi is...unpredictable at best
 I don't like Dell laptops unless it's a XPS. :p
 mm
 Same goes for the desktops. (Dell XPS <3)
 well they don't work half the time (inspiron)
 :p
 That's always down to the user.. hint hint ;)
 well here's the problem:
 have the time they either 1. can't find any wifi networks /at all/ because their adapter is such shit
 or 2. their battery fails completely making them junk
 gonna be doing a little talk show in about 45 mins if anyones interested
 we've had like 15 computers with their battery damaged so they can't start at all :/
 Their adapters are probably made by Intel ;)
 well they can't blame intel about their shit batteries
 now, the new shipment of inspiron 15xx whatevers came in last year
 those were very reliable
 ;p
 however the're missing for whatever reason and I haven't seen them at all around the school
 not even the staff are using them; they're using the old inspirons!
 What's the laptops called that start with "V" or ermm.. "L" ? ;/
 so they come to me and bitch about it >:/
 L: Lenovo?
 Yep
 Thats what I have

 i wrote a php script that accidentally went into a loop, and now as far as i know there are an infinite amount of txt files in my root directory

 There can't be
 Because your quota would limit it
 i can no longer login to my account
 it times out
 ugh im so annoyed, it's such a pain in my ass lol. This girl who is a really good friend designed our logo which is cool and all, but now everytime i do something that makes money, or could make money and has the logo on it my buddy (not the one who designed the logo but another guy in the band) has me pay this girl. i dont understand why i cant just pay her a flat fee and be done with it..
 thats not how it works buddy :)
 xD
 truthfully she came up with the logo, but it took her 3 mins, it was a random doodle that turned out to be something, i was the one who vectorized it and has actually put it to use on merch ive spent hours more than her lol
 hai kdigennaro

 Shut up, don't want to talk about crap now.
 That convo has been and gone. Now, bye. !
 er, towards Andrew
 And Acer needs to get their damn tech support up to date
 :P
 Pie`: Link?
 Why would you call Acer tech support? ;/
 hold on TheOracle
 its a 1.5mb jar file
 They are still in India, and the bitch that you call DEMANDS you tell her your SNID which she never understands
 on 0.10mb/s upload
 >_>
 ah wow
 Brandon, I call them almost daily for my work
 Lol..
 If it's the US Acer then that says everything. ;_
 ;)
 They won't give us a backdoor number so we have to use the frontline agents
 I'm calling india brandon
 lol
 Rofl
 Oh, don't expect them to know anything
 They get paid $2000 a year
 they don't know anything about computers
 :P
 they just look it all up
 Yes
 i always say google is ur friend ^^
 Only time I've got an american was when they transferred me to their damn service center in Texas
 xD
 And she was a hick and didn't know anything about computers either
 Andrew, what do you mean "Frontline agents" ? :p
 thats a very long leg you have there Cr`eme
 froma ll the way at the ototm of a shaft
 haha
 bottom **
 Pie` he's actually still falling
 its quite deep
 an extending elg? :O
 Lol
 im a bit jealous
 frontline agents are the customer support people that take all the calls then decide if they need to go to tier 2 tech support Brandon
 Leg*

 http://rapidshare.com/files/275347974/irc.jar.html
 i should rly have gzipped it
 but meh,.
 hehe
 hmm
 but its still, far form finished

 do you have a rapidshare account?
 nopers
 hmm
 why?
 you should use localhostr then
 they're pretty sweet, any non-lethal files free uplaod
 upload*
 no speed limits, and it stays there for 30 days
 cool
 btw TheOracle, when its open type /server irc.zymic.com
 theres no nick changing yet
 ;)
 hmm
 I see
 it wont say anything when you sign o either
 itll stay on connecting
 count to like 5 - 10 secs
 then /join a channel
 mmhmm
 you could change your nick if you did /nick nickhere
 beause any unhandled commands are sent as raw ctcp
 but the client wont do anything about it

 Anyone here heard about a practical attack on WPA-PSK?
 I heard of one for plain WPA
 Under 1 minute
 The one I've just been told about was PSK TKIP
 Last November
 It was news to me, thus the question
 TKIP is what I knew of
 Basically WPA isn't safe is all that needs to be known :p
 Go WPA-2 or AES
 My software at home doesn't support AES...
 WPA-2 support has been required for wi-fi certified products since early 2006
 So that's generally safe support-wise for now
 My comp was bought in 2005...
 i'm off for the weekend bye zymics
 Pie` needs a new network switch :<
 buy one
 Lenny, its almost 10pm
 ima have to wait till tomorow
 Amazon is always open

 :O
 how do you like that thus far
 Oooh nice!! Its rather white though, although that will probs go where there is content there :D
 yeah
 its also intended to be minimalistic
 with a bit more... depth
 :P
 Nice :)
 needs less white space
 lenny it will when theres more content
 this is just the ps draft... from here ill slice it and when i code it itll fix all the small things, too
 You use tables :O
 no =/
 Ben: hates tables
 :p
 And pukes when he sees them
 :o
 This is true, Cr`eme remembers :O
 I know
 I still use tables :(
 Jk
 No I dont
 :P
 hehe
 :/ I havent worked on Quixdraw For Like Ever after I went for a vacation :o
 :O where did you go ?
 :O I went to the beach for a week
 Oooh nice, have a good time ?
 Yeah :)
 Waves were realy big
 :D
 Mr Ed :O
 haha big waves = win!
 :O Ed 
 Tim did you miss me when I wasn't here ? D:
 Dolleh Left
 Hah, did you stand under the shelter at the end Ben? :P
 She/he/it went away

 She said she'd get some stuff from her for me :3
 Is that ED I see
 haha yeh, I went on every ride atleast twice! :D
 Thrope Park was good today though, the q's were sooooo small! Like I got on stealth twice in 15mins, I normally have to q over 2 hours for 1 go :/
 Hey Alan ;)
 Lucky Robert =[
 Felt a bit sick after that
 We had season tickets, so it was the first 30 mins when it was only us and the hotel guests
 haha Im a bit bored of Thorpe Park now, needs some new bigger rides. Iv been too much this holidays D:  Fright night will be good though, am going EVERY day! :D
 Merling pass FTW!
 Sounds good Robert, I want to do that D:
 I wouldn't do it now
 We used Tesco clubcard points to get the season tickets, made them cheaper than a day ticket
 Don't have that deal any more
 I used Tesco vouchers to get my Merlin Pass, was £30 of vouchers needed.]
 Actually might have been £37 not sure, but merlin pass = win :)
 Ben What number do you use for  £ ?
 Is i CTRL + 4
 ?
 it*
 Shift + 3
 :o
 Then where is #
 ?
 Inbetween the @ and Enter key.
 :s
 although depends on your keyboard.
 hehe
 http://www.impactlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/keyb.jpg
 :O
 It goes in abc order

 Your one ?
 No

 Ours doesn't, we have qwerty :)
 Oh we do to

 That isn't even a UK keyboard layout using QWERTY
 :P
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:KB_United_Kingdom.svg
 Wow that is wierd
 :P Just a little difference I would say
 Obviously others have more keys than that, but thast the basic layout.
 Have yall seen an american one? :O
 Yes
 Lack of Alt Gr seems somewhat silly
 :P
 Everything on the to row is different before number 4
 That isn't true
 1 and ! are the same I thought
 :p
 Yeah i forgot about that
 Wha does ALT GR do?
 I wish these bloody people would get out the pub so i can use the hd tv for my PS3 xD
 :p
 See the blue bits on the UK keyboard map image I linked, Cr`eme?
 Oh ok
 Yeah
 Those are AltGr + That Key
 é
 :O
 i didn't know about that XD
 AltGr+4 = ?
 
 Our computers have to have another language installed for that
 Cr`eme, they don't
 :O>-<
 é
 We dont even have those letters in it

 COD5

 I'm off out, be back tomorrow
 dam
 I had the most funniest notebook yesterday.
 It was sent in because the customer thought it was 'Radio active' like radiation crap
 uh, what?
 l0l
 He said.. When he shuts it down and puts it on his desk there is aways a green like. and it scares him and he can't sleep at night.. :S
 always*
 rofl...
 Like DUDE that's your fucking battery thing O_o.
 just keep it in for like a week
 and charge hi £150
 Haha.
 thats what most IT support firms do :D
 or, disconnect the light
 Acer doesn't charge that much ;)
 so it doesn't come on ;)
 That means removing it from the MB something I'm not willing to do :p
 jab a pointy stick into the LED ?
 Lol..
 then superglue the hole :D
 Haha, no.
 He'll get it back un-repaired.
 Then, I had another two units that had passwords on and the customers didn't provide them cause they are retards.
 For one it was owned by some paki from London and his password hint was "mother" so I typed mother... logged in.
 rofl..
 Most retarded password ever. xD
 nah, "password" is :D
 :p
 The other one was ermm for the hint "Keeep your hands off becky!!!" guess what the password was..
 becky ?
 Yep xD
 hahaha, users...
 people who need a hint for those kind of password shouldn't be near a computer
 haha
 Oh and another one was "footie" for the hint.. password was "millwall" and on the top there was a manu sticker .. like WTF?
 lool xD
 I tried manu/manunited/manufc then liverpool then arsenal then millwall. Kind of funny.
 `ping
 PONG
 Do you always guess the pass or sometimes do you login in safe mode ?
 I'm sure the people bringing in for that kind of support don't have the most secure passwords in the world
 Ben, you can't do the passwords in safemode with vista ;)
 Really? :O
 Yea.. really.
 That sucks
 Only XP
 Why not? :(
 We have programs to do it but.. Acer likes to charge people for password removals and recoveries if they have fucked with the partitions. :P
 When it comes to software they'll be charged but hardware gets done free if it's not done on purpose
 Omg,
 Cant anyone help?
 With what, Slurnade?
 Uhm, i went to the Hosting help.
 But noone awss replying.
 My site is suspended, I dont know why or how or anything.
 Awesome
 Nor do I.
 Ben you have to do him kai
 Ok
 Slurnade: please join #hosting
 I tried, noone is replying...
 Thats because none of the hosting staff are on xD Well apart from Brandon (who is doesn't have the passwords iirc) and Jack who is probs afk.

 Hello Robert
 Hello
 Hey
 "a spy is captured by his enemies and is sentenced to death. his enemies say 'you may make a statement, if you tell a lie, you will be shot. if u tell the truth, you will be hanged.' he makes his statement and goes free. what could he have said"
 can anyoen solve that? ^
 'You will shoot me'
 but if he says that then he is telling the truth
 but then they wont shoot him
 so he is lying
 so he will be shot
 so he will be telling the truth
 >_>
 "You might shoot me"
 Pie`: Exactly - neither can be made to be true, so they can't do either
 It's a fairly well known riddle in various forms
 so whats the answer ?
 'You will shoot me'
 ahh ok

 beh sorry im not djing just yet... gotta work out more legal crap -_-
 oh and note to everyone... listen to Robert in the future :/
 :O
 What have I done now?
 ^
 :/
 lol remeber when i asked for some legal advice?
 :p
 Yes?
 heh
 they tried to screw me
 He wasn't legit
 The spelling gave it away
 How far in did you get?
 http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/2620388/Devil-brothers-aged-10-and-11-admit-beating-and-torturing-boys.html
 :{
 Please say not very
 not legit.... but they are a registered company... just the way they went about getting me to sign stuff its basically them trying to steal my website and mainly domain name
 :p
 no not very at all... to "finalize the agreements" i gave them the login information to my control panel...
 They changed the pass?
 almost immediately they changed the password and contact info... but contact info takes 24 hours to change as a security feature
 That was very stupid
 so i was able to retrieve it and lock it down again... webhosters are monitoring my account too
 All this could be told from spelling
 lol they clearly breached the contract by doing that... and they technically havent even finished the actual sale part.. so therefore the contract is null and void =]
 2 lessons to be learnt
 :O
 HOMG
 First, big companies who know what they're doing can spell
 Ben :{
 or if they cant
 they find someone who can
 ;)
 2nd, if you want to be a big company, you need to be able to spell.
 Indeed
 @ Pie`
 yup... i learned my lesson =]
 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaanysways
 ima hit the hay Zymic
 :o
 nn Alex
 wait what
 imvoice
 haha when did that happen
 after we kinda argued about it for a little while... with them still claiming to own it... i told em end of story, conversation is finished, my lawyer will be in touch
 [00:05:23] * Ben sets mode: +v Pie`

 I thought you said you had school today.

 when i said i had school tomorow, it was still today
 ahh ok
 hm thats odd
 my webserver won't write files D:
 Oh not good D:
 Starting httpd: Syntax error on line 897 of /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf:
 format string must be an absolute path, or 'none'
 Why am I getting that? :(
 because you broke it
 Jacob why you keep sending me dirty messages? D: I has no credit.
 Hardly, I've just yummed it. :p
 :S
 What do you mean Ben?
 Ben: who said that was Jacob? ;)
 "Am I at home in my bed?" and "I will take that as a no. Please come find me."
 It was his number Pie` ;)
 hah o lawd..
 oh dear
 my webserver will read files and pritn contents to console
 When did you get that?
 but wont print to browser D:
 wait unless
 im missing headers XD
 brb lunch b ready
 While you're away Pie`, we'll be cracking into your computer.
 Ben: Jacob knows he is sent it and he likes you. I did say.. he likes the men.
 Jacob: 05-09-09 15:50 uk time.
 'the' men?
 Brandon save me? D:

 Morning
 Mainly being tired tbh
 And pancakes
 Lots of pancakes
 Why pancakes? :o
 It was decided that people wanted pancakes for brunch
 So we had pancakes for brunch
 Uh... brunch O_o.
 Why are you saying brunch that so MEH xD.
 Well, 11 is too late for breakfast?
 And I've learnt not to argue, just eat
 Not that late. I had my breakfast at 11:45. :)
 hey guys
 Bonjour
 i got a quick question, is there a trick for getting SSI's working here? PHP isn't my main coding language, but this is a side job i'm doing
 Nope
 SSI is an html thing isn't it?
 !google SSI
 www.google.com/search?q=SSI
 http://www.ssa.gov/ Social Security to Test Use of Microsoft's HealthVault in Disability Process  Social Security Holds Compassionate Allowances Hearing on Early-Onset 
 server side includes
 when i run PHP local, my code is like this: <?php require($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].'/includes/php/mastHead.php'); ?>
 and that doesn't seem to work here
 That should work
 What error are you getting?
 http://arcturisdev.vndv.com/templates/templateOne.php
 the file has includes for the mast head and footer...
 so, once i figure one out i can fix the second
 It's got the document root set as /www/ which is wrong
 Try setting a constant to the correct value and using that instead
  /www/vndv.com/a/r/c/arcturisdev/htdocs
 is the correct value
 Paul that's not allowed to be on kai thanks. ;).
 Sigh
 As I turned towards mah bed too
 O_o.
 Just make it so it doesn't announce
 Now you tell me D:
 Like that?
 Aye
 so why doesn't include implimention differ from server to server?
 Bye
 Sleep well Paul
 Ty
 Was up all night
 :D
 So was I? :p
 For the last two nights :)
 I was up from 8 am yesterday
 Till now
 And I partyed yesterday
 The problem here is the $_SERVER variable differing, not the include function
 :3
 `time Paul
 Time for Paul is: Sun Sep 06 08:09:10
 Mhm
 :p
 I keep thinking it is like
 so this would fail too: <?php require("/includes/php/mastHead.php"); ?>
 8 pm
 But its only 8 am
 Wtf
 Yes, because that would look for template/includes ect
 ok, let me try that...
 If you did require('../includes/php ect that would be fine
 i can't use ../ notation since this is a template and may site at different folder levels... that was my first thought
 I'd set your file routeinto a constant
 That'd be the best way
 do you have a howTo on that so i have a read...
 !docs define
 Defines a named constant
 !docs define
 define [PHP 4, PHP 5]
 bool define ( string $name , mixed $value [, bool $case_insensitive  ] )
 Defines a named constant
 http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.define.php
 Better
 Has no one really used that in here before?
 Thanks robert... i guess in my use, set this at the top of the page, and i should be ok, right?
 No, why would someone, Robert?
 zBot was win !
 Yes Arcturis
 I'm off for the day
 bye all going out
 Good night, hope you get murdered in your sleep Ben|Away
 Jacob: How do I find a folder a in ssh?

 Don't matter done it ;)
 Red red wine Lalalal.
 what headers does an http server need to write if a request was successsful ?
 You know what, Jacob..
 I feel like kb'in you :D
 Jack signed on at 2 Sep 2009 17:56:55 and has been idle for 63hr 52min 10s
 I'm impressed. :P

 What?
 I remember when I had my bot running for nearly 100 hours and Outlet the fgt goes and kills it because hes a fgt :(
 Someone tell Ed I need to talk to him when he's online. :D
 Brandon: locate or find
 Or really slocate
 slocate "dirname/"
 Pie`: that's 200 if you haven't already found out I believe
 Brandon: oh, and note you might need to do "updatedb" before that slocate call finds it
 woot, Pie`  has voice

 I lost by 1 point bowling last night :(
 25 euros for a week
 lol
 131 to 132
 ha
 Sides up or down? ;)
 Down
 My friend was given a strike that wasn't one too :P ... so I still technically claim victory, his engagement, so I let it slide
 Good, annoying when they're up to be honest, I would prefer they were down, other people however won't countenance asking them to be put down because they suck ;)
 so how is Zymic on this fine day
 Expensive much Ed?
 Ah, okay thanks Alex. I'll remember that for next time. :)
 Found it though :D
 Was bowling expensive Jack2?
 ye
 Not too bad actually, Â£5.50
 For what, unlimited or X games?
 Ah not bad then
 Usually its a ripoff
 Got much spending money, Jack2? :o
 Still in £
 Yeah, but I live in a chav town Jack2 ;) 
 need to convert
 pretty much 50:50 thesedays
 Just the 1 game Alex
 Don't we all, Ed? :p
 Really, can't remember the last time I only played one :p
 The women got the worst lane, they had their barriers up and still managed to get it in the gutter :P
 lolwut
 Ermm, the last time I played bowling.. it was on the wee xD.
 And the last time I played at a allay I was in year ermm 8 lol.
 We booked 3 lanes and people were late Alex, so we only got the chance for the 1 game
 wtf else is going to go bad this weekenbd?
 Your spelling, obviously. ;)
 beh

 what about that ILLEGAL stuff Pie` ?
 the illegal music ?
 some freshmen at my school are like 'omg, thats illegal! I bought my copy of windows Vista, yaaaaaaaaay'
 ew, who would want to BUY vista
 apparently them
 lol
 I would be on their side, except because I won't buy vista I use free software instead.
 :D
 Pirating paid software is not a solution
 Linux, yaaaaaay
 I'm not sainyg pirate it
 because that's illegal ;)
 If you don't like that something costs too much, the only workable solution is to boycott it
 Using it without paying helps to build market dominance, adoption and lock-in.
 I'm hoping I win a copy of Windows 7 Ultimate. I registered to host a Windows 7 Release House Party.. and with the house party host pack you get a copy of Windows 7 Ultimate
 o.o
 if you throw a house party you get windows 7?
 lolwut
 lol, is Bill Gates going to be there?
 Yes
 yep lol. No, I only have to invite 10 people. I've got 4 people in my house, so I can technically invite 6 people and be within their rules
 Bill Gates is also included in the house party pack
 lol
 It's obviously a clone
 Multiple people can become hosts
 A clone?
 hahah
 theres > 1 bill gates
 mini-bill
 Send in the clones!
 You really think Bill Gates has a clone? xD

 tells me browser/os isnt supported
 Then links you to IE or Chrome?
 only things at are are, ie 6 7 8 and firefox 3+ on xp, or ie 7 8 on vista, or firefox 3+ on os x
 prolly just IE
 Internet Explorer 6, 7 or 8 and FireFox 3.x on Windows XP SP2
 Internet Explorer 7 or 8 and FireFox 3.x on Windows Vista
 FireFox 3.x on Mac OS X v10.4 Tiger
 Shap, DarkKrai. :)
 should I dualboot osx86 and Linux or just keep xp and linux?
 xp and linux
 everyone knows max sucks ;)
 mac**
 Obviously not. :P
 You say it sucks because you don't know how to use it and don't have one tbh :o
 OSX itself is alright, it's the inordinate price of the hardware I could never understand
 People wanting to spend £500 on a shiny apple logo and OSX
 Pie` to tell me it he has one
 Only down side on Mac
 what?
 Woops
 xD
 Oh, plus the lock-in culture of apple
 The way it discourages open development
 I've used macs
 and they suck
 I never want to own 1
 I use macs everyday
 new iMacs at school
 I use something else everyday
 for programming
 iMacs... for programming?  Why did they waste so much money
 hah
 they wanted to use unix right
 get this
 they thought people would hate linux's UI
 im like
 serious?
 DarkKrai can program :O
 force them to use linux w/o a pretty window manager
 give them SHELL ONLY
 Keep it all on one line kaitnxbi fgt.
 MAKE THEM LEARN COMMANDS LIKE REAL MEN
 they are all windows people...
 DarkKrai isn't a man, right Brandon ?
 they are like aww come on, blah blah
 No, deffo not.

 I need help with web traffic I ordered with Zymic.com
 I haven't heard from anyone or know the status of my order since I made it last Thursday
 vavatau: You would need to speak to Jack or Ed about it, who aren't here at the moment. Ed will be on later though.
 @ about what time?? I'm in New Zealand and it's 6:15 am right now. I'm about to head to bed but might come back online later
 He said tonight so not really sure, in about 2-3 hours? Don't hold me to that though.
 thanx Ben, much appreciated
 Mmmm vegies <3
 No problem vavatau.
 so who's heard of full sail university?
 Me
 brandon you have?
 Indeed
 im thinking of doing the online gfx design course
 better use of 2 yrs than just freelancing imo
 Why?
 as i *have* to go to vermont for 2 yrs, and after that i could go to a real college for a more broad topic... comp engineering
 Brb chocking.
 Oh, don't do anything I wouldn't do Brandon

 That's random..
 Not funny, I'd say crawl. :p
 cruel*
 I would agree with you though
 I do think he's stuck
 http://69.244.39.40/rsr
 oops
 wow
 i didnt mean to paste that, oh well
 Why not?
 its a customers design
 clicked chatzilla instead of firefox
 they have the same logo as chatzilla is a ff addon
 youre free to give feedback on it if you want, its just a low budget customer though :P
 I like it hastings 
 thx andrew
 check out the new portfolio though
 Considering the logo is blue, have you considered bringing some blue into the content area?
 its farrrr better
 http://69.244.39.40/hastings/final9.7
 andrew - yeah, but its a $50 fully-coded project *including* that custom logo, I can't be bothered :P
 heh yea
 and i bet the code @ http://69.244.39.40/hastings/final9.7/code.html will make you much happier ;)
 Why..
 (compared to my older shitty code you hate)
 That blue on Final9.7 sticks out way too much. Almost hurts my eyes
 brandon ?
 andrew its diff on every screen man
 everyone has a diff comment on it
 :P
 Why, when I opened that it had a blue bg then changed to the images? xD
 its like... magic blue
 brandon its because its not coded
 when its coded itll be handy dandy
 :p
 hey all
 hi
 I don't know, it shouldn't hurt peoples eyes on some screens though
 hastings, getting better, still have a few extra divs that don't seem needed
 the head_portfolio_box divs aren't needed
 andrew you're right, below the nav its a little extra, as i coded it late last night
 itll be cleaned up
 as you can apply whatever style you have to the a tag or the img tags
 :)
 but im especially proud of the ul :P
 Looks good though
 thx =]
 Hey
 Hello
 hi @ all, i've a little question : Is Zymic 100% free?
 yes it is
 cool, i can have web space and a mysql db for free?
 correct
 as long as you follow the TOS
 TOS means?
 Olli-h: You have to pay for e-mail functionality
 Terms of service
 like "AGB" in german?
 Terms of Service
 Robert is right about that, but you do not need the email function to put up a website
 so i can setup a wiki page without email function
 Yes
 and who zymic make the money? :-)
 how
 ( sorry for my bad english )
 zymic doesn't make money from the hosting
 O_o
 they make the money only with advertising?
 hmm
 zymic doesn't put advertisments on your site olli-h
 we arent a company

 Okay that was weird..
 MSN just disconnected ><
 It wasn't me (8)
 And it's lost my channels again
 Brandon, what irc client do you use?
 Linkinus
 And is being ridiculously slow
 never heard of it
 okey
 It's for Mac ;-)
 You on wireless or RJ45, Robert?
 Wirless
 ah ic
 Wireless*
 Although I may be about to throw a cable out the window
 Try changing your channel to 11 or if it's 11 change it to something else like 10 or 8
 20 people online and not one person is going to talk but when I walk away I bet everyone will start talking :(
 loool
 Brandon, you going to be getting windows 7
 Why will I get windows 7 if I want OSX...? :/
 Reason for getting a mac xD.
 ahhh ic
 windows 7 is going to be the best :)
 they'll make it brillent because of vista
 Nope, no difference
 brillant
 *
 I've used it ;)
 i didn't bother with the beta
 Nor me..
 just wait for the offical release
 where did you use it then
 Microsoft gives an official copy of the operating systems etc..
 Was meant to be going to some windows 7 place but I said noty :p
 they gave you what
 a BETA?
 No.. they wont be installing beta copies on acer laptops already would they ? lol
 they would not give out free versions of it to people before the release date
 even then i'll be suprised if they give any out for free
 You're still missing the point and can't be arsed to explain, I have to get ready.
 yes sir
 `ping
 PONG
 I'm now on wired
 And it's still not working
 I've been away, I've touched nothing
 Robert, what's up
 No websites
 That's what's up
 And work to do
 no websites is what's wrong
 ok
 Can someone check if www.scriptlance.com is working?
 I know it is, just checked from downstairs
 yes
 So why the **** is it not working from here?
 Robert, are you using vista
 and what browser
 XP
 And all 3 of my browsers
 ill have a look on google for a solution
 I'm going to ping, going back to wireless
 k
 Oh, to make it wierder
 Google does load
 some sites do, just not all
 :s
 no one seems to have the problem on google :s
 Well, I'll be back on mibbit soon
 This is ruddy stupid
 But hey

 School sucks!! In IT we HAVE to use dreamweaver :@

 I prefer to use notepad than dreamweaver
 but eclipse > *
 Thats what I did for my GCSE IT
 hmm I suppose they wouldn't really know if I coded it in notepad and then just opened in Dreamweaver :D
 Not allowed to use .png files either, teacher said that its a Fireworks only file so not all people will be able to view our sites when its on the web and they are too big :/#
 so they are blocked...
 WTF
 lolwut
 firewor
 the only way it could possibly be a "fireworks only" picture is if you installed fireworks the gay way
 so ti eats up all image formats
 then he was talking about how internet works sending requests to server etc... he said that you must have a file called "index.htm" because that what it looks for, nothing else.
 lol
 NOOB
 lets bust him up with an html book

 What you guys think of these colours http://www.colourlovers.com/palette/949948/larvo ?
 I dont liek the yellow
 Ew ben
 I wouldn't use the yellow
 ah then its a bit better
 the blues are good
 wats it for?
 I want some light colours and a bit of blue
 Have to make some shitty portfolio site for all our school work to go in, we HAVE to use dreamweaver and tables :@ So I thought well atleast i could get some nice colours.
 Whats that darkrai
 Haxor?
 no, a picture
 omg
 :/
 why ben?
 lol
 dreamweaver
 xD
 tell them that if ther gona make you do something atleast let you do it the right way..
 kdigennaro: Instead of printing off all our work they want us to create a site with it on isntead, so its easier for marking etc...
 my programming teacher hates dreamweaver, we use textmate, which is win! :D
 that makes sense
 no, he meant using the dreamsuck, Ben
 but having to use dreamweaver doesnt
 kdigennaro: .png files are blocked apparantyle they are "Fireworks only files" and are too big...
 :O
 Pngs are awesome
 lmao
 put it on your own server
 heh i might actually
 thats what i did
 i would :P
 and fuck them, ill use css xD
 ^
 Robert: is logging a valid excuse?
 rofl
 the teacher made us use freewebs
 :O loggin
 i said fuck that, and I made my own xD
 Depends what for and who you are
 We have our own server at school, but 50mb allowence.
 lame
 As you're unknown to me, I'd say not
 use your own
 I will :)

 kdigennaro: Servers only look for files called "index.htm" when you send a request to a site not index.html, index.php, index.asp...
 haha tell him to STFU!
 ^
 lol whyd u tell me that ben? lol
 v
 i know that :P
 No he said only with the .htm extention
 not .html or .php etc...
 ooo
 it HAS to be .htm i was like WTF no it doesnt...
 It is probably a old server
 still seems like you could use html
 Becuase they used to use three letter extensions :p
 no he was using amazong as an example Cr`eme ;)
 o
 k
 He probs said that to not confuse the chavs tbh
 tell your principle hes not fit to teach the subject :P
 yeah
 haha init xD

 lol some boy "How do I make a folder?"

 true ^
 Its funny to watch them struggle ;)
 :P

 Cr`eme's moving up in the world and I see DarkKrai fell to the bottom slot (bet' cha Cr`emes happy not being the most annoying anymore)
 :o
 I am not annoying anymore?
 No Ben, it's scissors, paper and glue, and you don't need to do anything except shove it in the cd drive - the computer puts it together from there
 :D
 haha might try that Robert ;)
 Don't forget
 Computers can't open glue bottles
 You have to just squeeze it in
 xD
 ahh ok gotcha ;)

 Robert owes Ed Â£50 for me
 Oh yeh I got than after refresh too ;)

 Does there need to be a reason?
 Your script says so, so you must obey.
 Maybe a portion of $50 for the debugging :p
 But not £50

 who here is good with sliding doors O_O
 "good with"?  It's a fairly simple technique
 alex - http://69.244.39.40/hastings/final9.7/code.html
 Seems like if you can do it you can do it and that's it :p
 i wanted to use an a and a header
 and its... obviously not working 
 :'(
 its just that the a's bg goes further than the h3 itself
 For "Title Would Go Here"?
 yeah
 3Uptime: 1 week 4 days 9 hours 56 minutes 39 seconds
 You could put a <span> in there, bit of extra HTML mess, but it would make the background expandable
 I kinda lean that way over sliding doors for simple backgrounds
 bah humbug
 so youre saying a/h won't work flat out i guess
 Well, you could, but you'd have to nest the h inside the a and that doesn't sit well with me semantically :p
 But anyways, you can make the background images the two edges
 No need for the long image required by sliding doors
 And since there's no gradient element, the repeated central background can be defined by a simple colour background
 the h *is* inside the a...
 i want the whole h to be clickable... why wouldn't I do that...?
 theres no repeated central bg...
 The black
 I know there is no image doing that purpose
 .000001kb of black < a line of code for the bg color
 a solid black png is practically zero in size... im not too concerned
 and
 im coding this because in the footer there is a gradient
 and i want to be able to use the same sliding door code just change the bg image
 ooook then nvm
 hai honey, miseed ya
 http://69.244.39.40/hastings/final9.7/code.html <-- as you can see even w/o an a it's still doing the same thing >_<
 What was the last thing I said before I cut out?
 "i know there is no image doing that purpose"
 and then I posted (before you timed out)

 YouTube - How to make a BristleBot - Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories -- Rated 5.0 Stars
 sorry for large paste -
 <hastings>	.000001kb of black < a line of code for the bg color
 	<hastings>	a solid black png is practically zero in size... im not too concerned
 	<hastings>	and
 	<hastings>	im coding this because in the footer there is a gradient
 	<hastings>	and i want to be able to use the same sliding door code just change the bg image
 Fair enough, here's your reason for why it's doing that
 The sliding doors image is on div.door
 That div is full-width, the h2 is not
 Since the h2 is shorter than the div, the right edge of the h2 is inside the sliding door image background
 the div has no set width... thus should it be auto...
 maybe not eh
 i guess not
 so how would i make it auto... obviously width: auto; won't work
 You want the width-defining element to be the outer one
 In this case it's the h2
 So remove div.door, and make that code apply to the h2
 Then have an <a> that contains all the text, block it for clickable area
 And that will have the right-edge border
 outer...
 no
 outer is the div man
 oh
 sorry
 No, the width-defining element is the h2
 I misunderstood ya
 id rather not use an a, i was thinking about it and don't want it clickable (sorry)
 Right, well span
 Works just as well
 By the by
 This kind of markup issue you can diagnose in a snap by inspecting elements ;)
 aka... firebug
 Or similar, yes
 which im using, which hasnt helped me at all... maybe i just suck at interpreting their data
 Well, if you want to see how firebug shows the problem
 Bring up firebug, click inspect and click on "Title Would Go Here"
 That brings up the right section of HTML
 Then in firebug, mouse over the h2 code, then mouse over the <div> it's inside
 You'll see it highlights the area they contain on the browser canvas
 div.door is much wider than the h2, that's demonstrating the issue
 which makes no sense to me
 beacuse
 theres no set width
 *and* its 408px
 which comes from absolutely nowhere
 ...
 anyawy
 i fixed it using the span
 but i had to use a float on both the span and the h
 hastings, you got firefox ?
 which is kind of a bummer as i was trying not to use floats because clearfixes are a bitch too - not because they're hard/complicated but because *EVERYONE* tells me "you shouldnt use that clearfix, use this one", and it gets very fucking annoying, LOL
 pie` but of course
 install the addon "FireBug"
 from what I hear it wouldd be very useful to you
 hastings: by default divs take up the available horizontal space
 pie` i did man
 Because it's a block element, not inline
 alex ahh i guess that makes sense
 which clearfix might you recommend? the only one I know of is the one that uses content: '.' display: none
 which... only works sometimes
 http://www.webtoolkit.info/css-clearfix.html <-- that one
 although it seems to have worked this time... nvm heh
 thanks for the help alex, much apprecaited
 ps... what do you think of the design thus far?
 Looks fine to me
 substring is such an awesome method
 in any language
 Heh
 A strangely functional thing to wax lyrical about :p
 I mena, when I wrote the first version of Phot, I was doing loads of parsing from the incoming PING request and then replying
 when I could have simply done something along the lines of:
 out.println(ctcp.substring(5));
 (^ that's java ofc not php)
 Yes, I know ;)
 I recognise out.println
 If the syntax didn't suggest it knowing your background
 ;)

 omg, personal leave, he's going to see a shrink isnt he :O
 ah hokays XD
 too bored to explain the whole situtation
 but in short I won't be back fully til 6 days
 lol
 I got my account at college (note: UK, so pre-uni for those who don't remember ;)) frozen before because I had "hacking tools" on my account space
 I had notepad++-portable and firefox-portable
 although I've discovered Internet on the Wii and have been digging like crazy on m.digg.com haha
 haha Alex
 Lol.
 nice
 At College we had quake on the shared drive.
 and then they found it.
 so we put it onto a tutors dir
 heh
 Heh, I'm sure they would have complained about that as well
 lmao
 :P
 well I suppose I should go find a quick Tkinter PDF
 But as far as I can work out, playing quake and doom etc was about all they did
 It was always what they were doing if you walked past their office
 bah
 need to get Acrobat :X
 Funny thing was Alex.. The guest account had the same if not more privledges as tutors
 so, it was either you or the Russians then? heh
 you don't want acrobat
 far too bloated etc
 Dave: I just want to print a PDF >:/
 Well, they're never safe these things
 I'm only installing the reader
 They had set bios passwords for the machines
 surely that can't be /too/ bloated
 I don't know how this became widely known, but it got out
 foxit reader is good @ TheOracle 
 if not at all
 That all the rooms had bios passwords set on the theme of the lord of the rings characters
 Golum
 lmfao
 gimli
 the reader is ridiculously bloated
 Gandolf
 for a reader
 Gandalf*
 Gandalf? is it not
 not sure
 can't remember
 Gandalf Stormcrow
 Alex thinks so, so probably
 I dont bother trying to guess the bios password at my school
 i jsut remove the CMOS battery

 gray is american
 they have to be different

 @ hastings 
 andrew does now, fixed, but now the css is invalid and im gonna shoot it

 wtf, how have you made css invalid?
 I can't say I've ever done that
 opacity
 oh, don't use it, use transparent png images
 1px by 1px for solid color transparency
 what?
 im not using transparent png images
 its just making the whole png go less transparent
 ...:S
 I'm telling you to USE transparent png images
 you can't make an image less transparent. unless you have transparency set somewhere else
 therefore just make the transparency happen on the png image
 unless I don't get it

 Oh dear Alex :P -- obviously doesn't know about the value attribute either
 Hey Jack.
 Did you get email or msn message?
 Yes Ed
 Thanks for sorting
 Did you see his ticket replies?
 Yep, I replied a couple of hours.
 I'm guessing we got nullrouted for those domains

 bah
 I hate this wii keyboard
 will be back friday
 Hello s? who's s? ;)
 so 2 days not 6
 Theoracle, ed
 Oh hey. Where have you gone?
 too lazy to ident
 grounded haha
 hey
 excited tho
 Good thing you have the wii :P. Do anything particularly worthy? 
 can you upload a .zip cotaining a .mp3
 It's possible, but we suspend people we find who do Lenny 
 ah
 What's the mp3 of? :p
 no, it was a theoretical question
 gonna write a irc client
 w/ python and wxpython
 Dreamhost VPS
 yes/no
 when i'm back ofc
 So....tired... ;_;
 thinking of a name until fri.
 hey Pie`
 hi s/TheOracle
 Not sure Lenny, shared hosting I have with them hasn't really had any major problems.
 well, that's good enough for me
 I was going to grab a shared for a bit then upgrade when need be
 bah
 aew
 ist protected too
 hi
 jerk
 Lenny: looks alright given the spec, I've not used them, but it seems a relatively sane platform ;)
 It's Debian not CentOS, and that's a major plus :p
 yep
 152 emails now
 ;o last.fm had a skin update
 CentOS is red hat based
 which is pretty lame
 Fedora is interesting
 if i quit then bye
 But other than that I'll keep a wide berth of RPM based distros
 wouldn't use a fedora server tbh
 CentOS is behind the fricking times, python 2.4 because python 2.5 breaks yum, great!
 Well, no of course not :p
 Fedora is unstable
 It's a hobby desktop distro
 2.6 ftw
 But it's probably one of the most "bleeding edge" and yet well supported distros about
 dun like 3.x tbh
 Sometimes good sometimes bad, usually interesting ;)

 3Uptime: 1 week 6 days 10 hours 59 minutes 55 seconds
 I've done better a few times... ah the good 'ol days, rifle only was like that though
 It depended a lot on who was online
 I was average, but occassionally I'd get a room full of relative newbies (you never get real newbies in rifle only :p)
 And then going onto non-rifle only servers if there weren't many people so it wasn't much of a spray map
 Then you'd have lots of people running around with stuff like a thompson or a BAR, they never get close to someone who's good with a rifle ;)
 'course
 If I ended up in a room of clan folk or similar for rifle-only, then they're almost untouchable
 Which is why I wouldn't even try to get back into CoD1 now ;)
 The only people left online are those people
 pff COD1
 The best CoD ever made ;)

 hi Sazzad!
 Hey Pie`
 sup Sazzad ?
 Been a while since I came on IRC. 
 Nothing much Jacob. 
 We noticed. :)
 Oh how does this look so far (ignore the text body) http://iamshipon1988.rit.edu/freedom_site_documents/document_types/generic_webpage/general_webpage.bd.html
 timeour
 timeout
 Gah. Ok try this link: http://jorsek.com
 i finished adding the new fetures to my site
 Looking alright Sazzad 
 my maze site is now ready for me to start working creating a way to customize individual accounts
 but i was wondering
 Drazilaustin: What is the link to your site
 http://mazemaker.vndv.com/index.php
 when making a form can you make a picture into a submit button in php
 Drazilaustin, it's sort of obvious you know don't exactly what PHP is
 well
 i specified php because i was pointing out i am not looking for javescripting as an answer
 because the form is in a php document
 no, the form is outputted from a PHP document
 the form is in an HTML document
 as the form is written with HTML tags
 PHP just outputs the HTML tags
 i know
 the form isn't written in PHP
 but i was tole javescripting wont work in php
 *told
 JAVASCRIPT is like the plague
 It goes everywhere
 ^
 its not PHP that would have a rpoblem with javascript
 it would be the browser
 PHP - Server side; JaS - Client side
 JS*
 uh i will brb i am going to lunch so i need to switch computers
 Jacob Javascript is not like the plague. It's hard to make it work well, but it does one heck of a job
 Without Javascript we couldn't make our software work.
 AJAX is much better
 and jQuery
 You do know those are Javascript
 AJAX is Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
 Yes, but with additonal features.
 [16:52:17] <%Sazzad> Without Javascript we couldn't make our software work.
 What software are you reffering to ?
 His XML CMS
 lol..
 Yup
 so when you say "our", you mean "YOUR"
 Sorry, I'm at the office and mis-spoke

 Oh.. another company stealing apple macs keyboard :p
 Who knows why, mac keyboards are horrible
 The silver I guess
 Acer did it with the new Acer Timelines
 But I prefer the black
 Yea, black is nice.
 The whole "make it as slim as possible" results in absolutely no real tactile feedback
 I was more thinking the gaps in between each key like the mac keys :p
 Expensive though
 Oh, so these ones are still functional? :p
 haha
 http://laviolette4use.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/acer-notebook11.jpg < look at thet keyboard.

 I assume you were talking about iMac keyboards being thin, Alex?
 Yes, mostly the desktop ones
 Not too much you can do with laptops
 Heh, yea. I like the iMac keyboards nice and sleek and they're comfy :

 Selgomezfan*
 yea?
 Ah well its a way of tracking objects in coding
 Selena Gomez is 17
 DOLLEH :D
 1 hr !!!
 finally Dolleh!
 Also check out that song!
 Its very clever, because it integrates with Vim so you can simply hit a button and it'll take you to where the object is defined
 Hello Dolleh
 sel gomez is gonna be 18 soon
 i know that!
 as long as that object location is defined in a "tags" file in the cwd.
 or is it 17?
 im her #1 fan!
 does she know that?
 Therefore its a very nice way of searching through code
 lol, ill be sure to tell her how many fans u have here...
 she is turning 17!!!!!
 or do you tell that to yourself before you go to bed
 Hello Dolleh
 Ha Ha verry funny!
 Dave
 Found a song you may like

 As in the i8n?
 bye, have a torrent to dl
 Nooooooooooooo don't leave us DarkKrai! You're the only sane one among us.
 That's a hideous mnemonic really.
 oops, >.>
 No, as in the code searcher
 %wik ctags
 "Ctags is a program that generates an index (or tag) file of names found in source and header files of various programming languages." - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctags
 Oh no, never
 holy fuck you guys
 You should try it, it works excellently with vim
 I believe its ^[ or ^]
 ^___^
 holy fuck you guys
 theres a game of tetris
 un uTorrent
 Got a screenshot please TheOracle?
 in *
 Ed: Its a command line util
 Pie`: That's the second time you've made a mistake
 Command line / shell *
 You spelt in as on in pm ;)
 if you have uTorrent, open it up go to help > about utorrent
 then press T
 Brandon, #chan is a room
 so it would be in, and not on
 I'm on the zymic irc network
 but in the channel #zymic
 http://www.grabup.com/uploads/961ba883b87b3da704777508f1def963.png?direct
 oh that was supposed to be or D:
 I gathered ... and I spelt or as on now >.<
 haha
 but yeah, tetris game in uTorrent :D
 help > about utorrent
 press T
 T
 oh I see TheOracle 
 If you're asking about how the tags file looks then you can take a look at this: http://grab.by/3XV
 TETRIS!
 Basically it maps objects to their respective locations where they're defined
 weird
 I.E. I use vim to trace the object "origin.nick" to its defining point in the irc.py file
 my youtube account is True1SelenaGomez! check it out!
 No
 Stop repeating yourself?
 sorry!
 ew!
 ew!
 ew!
 fgt
 anyway
 I've done a hell of a lotta torrenting
 if it comes across multiple objects of the same name it shows a prompt like this: http://grab.by/3Y1

 She's one weirdo.
 all in all its a very handy tool for large code bases, like in my case - pyDelphi.
 i am not!

 Let me get a list hold on
 CRAP!

 where did you learn php?
 I learnt the basics off w3schools
 03:59 Jacob [jacob@jacobbednarz.com] requested unknown CTCP CLIENT from  CookieMonster: 
 the rest was self taught
 That's naughty.. 
 w3schools seems to over complicate things
 I tried pointing my mate to it and he was dum founded
 You're right, they do. 
 php.net is where I learnt
 Started out with their simple tut and just worked from the links in the tutorials and then onto the rest of it
 Is there anywhere else that provides a half decent tutorial for it?
 www.tizag.com seems pretty popular
 I eat Jacob's for breakfast!
 Have I done it i again Jack? lol..

 <Brandon> good

 <Jacob> where did you get it from?
 <Brandon> Get what from? :/
 <Jacob> The background idea
 Jacob, topic applies to you too.
 xD.
 wtf
 I hate how you do that
 You're here one sec and not the next.
 Kinda freaky.
 How are you Alex? Back to uni soon?
 Alex is a mysterious man.
 In about a month, Dave, well, bit earlier because of moving into my house
 Term starts on the 12th of Oct
 You?
 Ahh yes, I'm heading down Thursday and then term starts on 28th Sept
 I remember it being significantly earlier than you last year
 Yeah, ended up that way, to be fair some people finished way before me in return
 Especially someone I know who was doing history at cheltenham.  Had his exams first week back of the third term, and then he was done
 So he finished over two months before me :p
 I think mine was similar.. because we only have 2 terms
 Crazy welshlanders
 :p it's pretty standard from my experience
 Not from real universities ;)
 I start uni soon-ish
 rubbish :p
 I mean, you've got to have a certain amount of days or you don't count as full time students, which is something like 25 weeks
 Most universities do 30+ from what I've seen
 We have 2 elongated terms I guess.. most seem to have the same system.
 Lends itself to three terms ;)
 I guess you have exams before Christmas or after?
 First weeks back of 2nd term
 Then end of 3rd
 Well we have 2 weeks extra where we start back before you
 1 after Christmas
 Then I imagine we finish later.. we had 4 weeks after Easter this year to end the second term. Then exams started.
 If you're lucky to have your exams timtabled in the first couple of weeks then you finish really early.
 Most people finish in the last few weeks of term 3 for ours, they don't schedule final exams that early
 Probably because they actually have a full year of teaching for everyone ;)
 I dispute most universities having two terms though.  Even this history folk nominally had three terms.
 And some people had to be there for the length of the third one, I just find it a sign of laziness that some courses can't fill a year
 hello Dolleh 
 heyhey jacob
 I mean, you're paying for a full year in fees, and they only got 2/3rds
 I would love to go to uni but I wouldn't be able to coupe =(
 I would actually be a bit annoyed if I had paid that and didn't seem to get my money's worth

 Alex: The same happens here. IT students pay for dorms/courses for the full year and the last 3 months is nothing 
 sad
 Wow, that sucks, Tim
 Yup
 Happens every year. Thought this year would be different lol
 hah i'm a dad hater for life already, this confirms my dad-hate lol, dad's just suck!
 Got my hopes up for nothing.
 Dolleh: I could be a dad
 Haha
 "could be"?
 If you're not sure I find I don't have too much respect for you :p
 Alex: I surely hope not.
 hmm that sounds suspisius jacob..
 Aww hehe thanks
 (that she isn't preggers)
 I would need to take for a trip down the stairs
 Bbbrrrrrbbbb
 How charming
 C'Mon Alex. Think about it.
 Stairs is the cheapest and smartest option without making it too obvious
 what are you on about?
 He's contemplating throwing his girlfriend down the stairs I think, and deciding it sounds like a good plan
 :/
 XD
 Dolleh said she was a dad hater now taht Tim's dad didn't send him a message for his birthday, I then said I could be a dad (directed at Dolleh) and Alex made an asumption she was and then I proposed my solution if she was
 I didn't assume that, I said if you weren't taking precautions to be damn near certain you aren't then I didn't respect you.
 Ah, I see.
 I is.
 I barely look after myself let alone a small human also
 I'm afraid it didn't quite come across in the jocular manner you may have intended.
 Obviously not. :(
 Jacob likes men.
 old news
 I agree Dolleh. :)
 Dolleh: Ident. :)
 hmm I need to go on the bike, or will I take mom's car? hmm...
 genious
 Dolleh, take the bike.
 bleh D: stupid bike! why not the caaaaaaaar??
 Silly idea Brandon 
 Dolleh: I vote car.
 I'm going to spend Â£600 on a nice wee bike to get around.. still use car but bike you get more exercise.
 Want that Mac keyboard Brandon or not?
 Comes fully boxed! Brand new!
 I use bike every bloody day, I want car for once!
 Brandon: Get the keyboard and send it to me.
 I need one for work
 I will pay you to send it to me
 must be cheap though
 Lol to AUS
 It would cost more than its worth

 No

 If you can pull it fully a longbow is, but that's not easy ;)
 Longbows are very English as well, which is always a plus
 :P
 Crossbows are much easier :)
 Well, you can use a lever when winding them so yes.
 .
 crossbowa bore me, curves are nice, but longbow is yay
 Several years ago when I was a pain in the arse in school. They would send you to some place (forgot what its called) and they take you to do loads of activities for 2 months. I'd say it's weird because.. it's like a treat for someone being a pain in the arse whom shouldn't be treated.
 arn't you still a pita? :P
 Flat hollow unleavened bread that can be split open to hold a filling? Nope..
 Heh.
 SO who's keyboard is it ffs?
 Nah, I'm not a pain in the arse anymores.

 gah *
 I need to work out how to find the Content-Length of an image in java D:
 or at least a guide on how to upload an img via POST 
 Just dissect a multipart post request, it's basically a bunch of headers at the top, then a tokenised envelope which the file uploads / fields are stored in
 But i need to get the length of the image
 Read the stream until you reach the end of the boundary for that image field
 Ed: Sarah Wayne Callies.. would you? ;)
 She's the doctor in prison break right?
 Brandon: I would
 Yes, Ed. :)

 Ed: http://pastebin.com/m5e3d467d
 what exactly is that
 It's the POSTDATA from a POST request to upload an image to tinypic
 is like, all the required
 What's wrong with pastesite ;)
 pastebin was quicker to type :p
 -----------------------------41184676334 -- that is the boundary it defines an envelope for each field.
 If you either find -----------------------------41184676334 it's the end of that specific element, or -----------------------------41184676334-- is the end of all elements
 Boundary is declared above
 along with the content-type ?
 Content-Type=multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------41184676334
 Well content type will be multipart/formdata
 *form-data
 the content type for files are in the related boundary envelope
 Yep that's the one which declares boundary
 so extract that, continue iterating over the lines
 so basically jsut print out exactly what i pasted?
 Well the boundary is unique for each request, so that will be needed to be generated, but pretty much yes, you also need to calculate the content length 
 is the boudary defined by the browser or specified by the server?
 or is ti just a string of randomly generated unmber
 that doesn't really mean anything
 By the browser, but if you're creating your own post request, you'll need to create it yourself.
 Doesn't java have a curl wrapper?

 most likely
 seeing as his view on the UK is biased :)
 Like the USA did all of it
 mm
 I've just installed 'iftop' Alex :p
 They contributed, but let's be honest, at least half of that front was us...
 I mean, who took out the luftwaffe?  Think that was us ;)
 As you may have seen in another channel ;)
 Is it possible to setup name servers with a name records?
 Us and the Canadians were more than half the D-Day landing forces
 And taking out the Canadians we're still only just behind the US landing forces
 The SAS were pretty kick-ass in that war as well
 But well, I suppose we can let the Americans have their dreams of grandeur
 If the US hadn't gotten involved, I wonder if things would've really changed that much :p
 When the soviet war machine got started, it really got started ;)
 Love how they make the nukes a "noble" seeming act, to save the world
 When it's far more likely it was to save American pride since the soviet union was cleaning up to join the fight against Japan and the US didn't want to look weak
 So they committed mass-slaughter
 Did I take this conversation a bit too far into historical debate? ;)

 "lost"?
 They've finally de-activated it
 Just in time for the new term!
 Ah, right, presumably because they're handling the new enrollments now
 Indeed
 I re-enrolled, so mine is safe :p
 At least the main computing services one
 Haven't tried my department one
 Not that they're really notably different, and it'll be working before I get department stuff to it
 One is @york.ac.uk, the other is @cs.york.ac.uk :p
 I do have an oxon address
 I just can't remember it...
 And it's only a forwarding address
 My department one forwards to my main email
 Because they can't be bothered to do a web interface for it
 Apart from the intranet
 Which you can get remotely, so I could have done that
 Lots of people are complaining about the Oxford E-mail
 But they suggest going into the department every day to check for notices etc
 They're updating it (which it needs...)
 Who the hell does that? :p
 That's what e-mail is for!
 I think someone should design a skin for the new system to make it look like the old one
 Would make lots of people happier!
 Well, they say, since you should be going in every day anyway, just check your email then :p
 It's not like we're even in the department more than a few days a week when term is on
 We don't have lectures there
 When does your term start?
 12th Oct
 A while yet then
 Yeah, 'course will be moving in a week or so before that
 Luckily I don't need to sort anything out for the house before I get there though
 We've got two chinese people who've been living there already since the end of last year
 So they already have all the services like ISP set up
 We just have to turn up, get an inventory done with the agency, get the meters read and start paying from there
 That's useful!

 Who knows a good sftp client?
 Konqueror/Dolphin?  ;)
 Or are we not talking Linux here
 Doesnt matter I could just get on linux
 Heh, well any DE file manager on Linux will do it nicely
 Ok
 One of the nicest things about Linux, a feature that came from KDE
 It allows you to treat most common network interfaces as part of the local filesystem
 :o
 sftp/fish is one of them
 But you can open it up in the filemanager, and then you can open the files from the file manager in any KDE application
 So if you want to edit something via SFTP using Kate, you use the normal open file dialog
 Well I just noticed a good thing. That I installed ftp access to my server. 
 So I dont need sftp :p
 Enter the sftp://user@host/ URL, navigate to the file, and then open it
 But I will use that program you told me too
 <3 sftp
 Then when you save it, it saves to the remote host :p
 :p ok
 And of course you can still have remote files via any of these network wrappers in a session
 So that it remembers the open files and opens a set of them on demand
 Dreamweaver has nothing on any KDE editor in terms of connectivity ;)
 And Dreamweaver is a bloated mess :p
 :o I just noticed aptana has sftp access

 Hi!
 Hey
 ÐÑÐ¸Ð²ÐµÑ
 Dave.. you need to have translate on yourself to translate it ;)
 I don't want it on for me.
 He wants me on him.. ;)
 Only he needs to understand :p
 Who said anything on the Russian?
 He didn't last time

 You can speak Russian, Rdx47 
 Rdx47 speak in Russian
 That's good:) Because the transfer is still not very clear:)

 I cannot razobratsa as hosting the correct configuration file permissions
 O_o.
 I can anyone else help?
 This is a hosting question and should be asked in #hosting
 At lesat
 :P
 least*
 I think it is
 He said something about hosting so I would have thought so. :)
 Yes, assuming it's ours, something about file permissions
 It seems you do not quite understand:)?
 Is it that you can't set file permissions?
 Is it that you don't know what the permissions of a file should be?
 CookieMonster: ShutUp!
 But :)))) I need to know how to correctly set up:)
 http://www.zymic.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=343 does that help at all?
 It is necessary that these files are seen PHP script but did not have access to them by other users
 If you ask your question in Russian, it might make more sense?
 Oh, right so you don't want it to be user accessed, but you want the application to have access?
 Create a directory in which you will contain these files and put a .htaccess file in there which sets access to Deny All
 I won't try and be more specific than that, google may find you russian explanations if that's what you want

 No, for Robert
 Does anyone know how to get the latest version of python with sudo? Becuase I aint familiar with sudo yet.
 my fart stinks
 lol
 O_o
 Cr`eme: you realise that sudo is only a means for privilege escalation, it doesn't do things like get packages
 oh
 You just have to have elevated priviliges to do that
 What do you mean by elevated?
 You log in as a normal user
 ok
 That user has access to modify the files in /home/username/
 uhu
 It is not allowed to modify system files
 Sudo has the same privledges as maybe an "administrator" would have in Windows.
 But I am root
 I have root access
 The "root" user however can, and using sudo the command you say "do the next command as root"
 you really shouldnt be logged in as root just for usage.
 Just stop Alex.
 lol
 Well, it's not quite that in Ubuntu because 'buntu doesn't have a normal root user, it's run with root's UID
 kk
 Really, in which case you may well have a normal root user, I'm not sure how deb sets up these days
 ok
 And you say you're logged in as root now?
 yeah
 Debian does allow that
 And you're on IRC, and browsing the web
 Although you should have it disabled
 No
 I have two users
 one root
 I meant your desktop session
 I only have acces through ssh
 So I dont understanf what you mean.
 I assumed a desktop machine, I suppose this isn't
 No matter
 But yes, go ahead and start googling
 kk
 You really ought to know how apt-get works
 :P
 (apt is the thing which handles packages like python)
 (not sudo)
 oh
 Then how do I get it with apt
 ?
 Surprisingly, apt-get

 Where did Jack go?
 Pinged twice
 Typical.
 Silly BT
 I have BT...
 Since when do I ping? :p
 you obviously have good BT then :P
 Heh, apparently so.
 I'll be on BT from Thursday :(
 Why?
 new house in Cardiff
 Lol.
 BT isn't that bad.
 I wish they gave dedicated IP's Addresses though.
 IP*
 Because I mean, most ISP's do now. But BT. You know the Home server things, if people are getting them and have a dynamic IP Address then their faked tbh :P
 I'm BT too
 And I'm always pinging
 You suck.
 I hardly ever ping. :p
 Fast ping, right? :o
 Jacob: I've still not had anyone ask about hosting :p

 Aww.
 How unfortunate.

 hmm
 crazy monster :p
 Hi!
 Hey :)
 I has my charger whoooos!!
 hey Ben
 :)
 It's been a while Ben, you pretty well recooped and back in school?
 Yep got lots of loverly essays to write :(
 the blessings of workin the grey matter
 lol
 Good to hear that all has gone well and you're now active again
 yeh thanks, should be able to start rowing again soon whooo
 Warning: helloworldapp\HelloWorlApp.java modified in the future.
 That's quite worrying...
 lol
 Just realised I mispelt world...
 What's gotten you into Java, Robert?
 A job interview
 On Friday
 Thus the hello world app :p
 Heh, well, have fun, and never on any account use BlueJ ;)
 Eclipse or similar is much more bearable :p
 I haven't come across them yet...
 Netbeans :)
 ^^
 What I'm using
 They're all Java IDEs (support for other languages, but they're aimed at Java and written in Java)
 Eclipse is FOSS
 Netbeans is from Sun
 And BlueJ is mostly maintained by some university, but it shouldn't be
 It should be quickly forgotten
 !wiki BlueJ
 www.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=BlueJ
 Heh BlueJ has a NetBeans BlueJ Plugin 
 It opens every package, and every class in a separate file
 You end up with a task bar completely full of windows you can't sanely navigate even in a small project
 So irritating
 I've got eclipse on here, mainly because it has an Android plugin, despite the fact I've never used it for Android stuff :p
 I did use it to write up a quick JUnit test for some uni work
 But other than that it's just sitting around taking up space ;)
 I would rather not use Java where possible
 I'm not sure whether I'd take this job if I get it
 Half of me (probably more) likes the idea of freelancing
 It's just a bit risky...
 What's the job like?
 Or is it a big enough company that you don't know
 www.card.co.uk
 Until you ask
 They have small teams, from 2 to 6 people
 developing smart cards and associated software
 So this is like RFID and Chip/pin type stuff?
 Yep
 Could be more interesting, but it certainly sounds interesting enough :p
 More on the backend systems end
 Definitely...
 The front-end and hardware stuff I wouldn't be interested in
 Well, I wouldn't mind designing the front-end, but building it is tedious :p
 hey
 http://gunji.uni.cc/images/screens/Gunji.png is awesome amirite?
 noobcakes in class think i stole it :/
 you make?
 yes, i MADE IT
 oops
 caps
 lol
 its basically impossible to code without flash
 and i dont really like it to be honest
 to many textures
 logo is kinda cool
 Grunge taken too far
 It's gloomy, too dark.
 ^
 its a game D:<
 doesnt matter
 what kind of class is this that you are in? Seems like a lame one if you class mates consider that good :P no offense lol :D
 lol
 they dont
 they think i stoled it
 D:
 So they don't even think you can design badly?  Oh dear ;)
 why would any one want to steal that layout? :P lol
 How little respect they have for you :p
 lmao!!! 
 no thet thought i used a psd template or something
 why would they care if it's a horrible template? :D
 To be honest, the worst things are, it's just too dark, and particularly the typography is awful
 I agree, the texture's are kind of cool they're just over used. Use them in moderation.
 The main navigation and the headings underneath are lacking in contrast and the font is pertty nasty
 pretty

 Robert then you don't know what music is if you agree with the Ed ;
 Be quiet
 And listen to real music
 :
 I am listening to real music! http://kube.totalkiss.com/?jumpto=kiss100  <-- Best radio station ever!
 Im sure Tom would agree with me if he was here.
 http://mediaweb.musicradio.com/player/default.asp?s=2 is real music
 ewww classic
 eww kiss
 although
 i luv dis song
 little boots - rememdy
 i luv it ;D
 Kiss100 = WIN!!
 Everyone jams to it in the common room at school
 haha at school we all had to make a folder in this remote folder, teacher had a list of them on the board so you can see them as you make it. This boy put a .bat file in there called "Click Me" the teacher saw it, clicked it then it shut his computer down lool
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McdqerXrwXE&fmt=22
 YouTube - Little Boots - REMEDY -- Rated 5.0 Stars
 i fucking love that (:
 As a learning exercise
 I liked Meddle Pie`, she's gone a tad main stream now though
 I don't even like this style of music
 I jsut really like that song hah
 plus she's kinda hot imo
 go shower you dirty whore ;)
 haha shh you know, the genre of music ;)
 http://grimestation.co.uk/
 ben, musics time ARE YOU ON?
 I am Dolleh :)
 I have to write an essay for tomorrow but cba :(
 Jade Ewen - My Man  <-- Tune
 great
 my headphones are fucked
 :rage:
 Not got more than one pair?
 I have two sennheisers and some cheap ones in drawers :p
 Unless these are the big portable "wireless" ones that cost a fair bit
 I wouldn't have more than one set in that price range
 the wire is coming apart i think
 because if i waggle the cable around about sound cuts out/goes a bit patchy
 At what end?
 If it's coming apart at the audio jack end you can replace those
 Little bit fiddly in practice, and it means the wire is shorter than before
 But you can do it once or twice before it's silly provided you don't make a mistake and have to cut off extra wire
 nah, its where the headphones connect to the wire
 hmm friend just said to me "byee m8, say gd bye to the rest of em for me yh." then went offline, kinda worried :-/
 Hello
 maybe
 maybe not
 who knows
 :O
 he emo ben?
 o_O
 Nope, more chav tbh
 hmm
 hah
 Alex: fixed em :p
 Ben: could I have a copy of winup?
 or non of them work?
 Bit of electrical tape, Pie`?
 Its not coded yet Cr`eme, been to busy.
 :P Ok
 Alex yeah ;)
 I tape the wire to the ear cup
 taped *
 in a position where the noise isn't affected
 because if it was in a different position it wouldn't be patch
 Ben: do you know any good ones? 
 Snagit
 :O
 Thankd
 I bought a new inkjet for my printer today, the box is pretty woo!
 A new inkjet for your printer?  A new inkjet printer or is this a replacement part
 oops, inkjet cartridge
 THE FAIL, I blame heavy day ya
 Ah, not as interesting as either of the things I was thinking :p
 lol
 i'm very boring sorry :P
 Expensive stuff printer ink, hate having to buy it, waste my money on it :p
 hah I got discount 2X >D
 Alex: do you know anything about the HD 218 headphones made by sennheiser?
 Alex... ebay ;)
 If you can wait :p
 I ran out at university last
 I always keep a little stock pile
 Went into town, found out apart from one shop that didn't have the ink I wanted in stock all of the shops you'd normally go to on a highstreet are out on the far edge of York
 So the only place I could find ink in the town centre was Argos
 Not cheap ;)
 Anyways, I do have spares now
 Found on my old printer, it was cheaper to buy a new printer than ink cartradges for it xD
 http://www.iaza.com/work/090915C/woo89702.PNG
 Not too environmentally responsible though :p
 woo for the box!
 You can get the cartridges refilled
 Though they don't hold as much as was originally in them that way
 In any case, I'm never going to be happy spending any of my money on it
 It's like having to buy carpet cleaner or socks, I don't want to spend my money on these things :p
 lol
 haha
 Cheap basket ;)
 ^ ;D
 You're telling me you'd be pleased buying that stuff, Ben?  :p
 Very easily pleased I suppose that you can find buying socks as interesting a night out ;)
 Nope, but i do like a new pair of socks everyone now and then :D
 as a night out
 ben, I said 'yup' on msn, but msn is a bitch
 Going to lump on M$ shares soon
 Ok Dolleh :D
 Alex you sussed me ;)
 ben you scared him ;D
 hehe i know, he doesn't like chavs ;)
 ben, some names? dangerous? evecuade the dancefloor? or which?
 but then who does?
 dangerous
 :)
 have that one, now msn needs to stop bitching at me
 ._.
 I feel worried I know those are Cascada songs :P
 Cascada = win!
 ^ false
 Ed why worried ?
 ;)
 OMG ed was secretly watching us D:
 HOMG
 he's like those bushman D:
 *ninja
 Yeh, I think he wants our musics Dolleh T_T
 so does Alex!
 OMG 
 ed, you wont get no music O< GO BACK IN YOUR BUSH
 NO music*
 ^
 hes like a creme!
 HOMFG
 what if its a twin ben? D:
 HOFG!!
 even jack2 got scared shit...
 its THAT bad
 :O
 I think we should ban him
 hmm great idea
 Do you not get bored of shouting "HOMFG" at one another?
 I just ask because it's been a really long time now, is it not old?
 I've gotten bored just reading it
 Dolleh msn being poop, it wont let me talk to you :(
 gah O< the bitch
 Nope Alex
 nope alex, cause ben didn't say HOMFG, he said HOFG! geesh
 ^
 I mean, call me silly, but I like a bit of meaningful conversation :p
 I'll save the inane stuff for when I'm drunk enough to cope
 Think of a good topic to talk about then, instead of you and Ed wanting our musics ;)
 Alex: did you say you had a set of sennheiser's ?
 ^
 Two, Pie`
 what ones ahve you got
 PX100s and some more earbud-style ones that I forget the model for
 I kinda wish I'd gotten the PX200 instead at the time
 Not much more
 ah good
 are the PX 100's worth the cash ?
 my friend recommended them too me, im considering it
 Well, what counts as good conversation to you, Ben?  Tech news is easy enough to start
 PX100s are nice, yes, noticeably better sound quality than you get from most headphones
 That said, the PX200 has the sound insulation around the edges, and that means you can have lower volumes and hear more of it
 Were I buying again I would probably go PX200
 are the PX100's worth the £43.69 ?
 Jesus, where's that? :p
 the sennheiser website :p
 sounds good
 You can get it cheaper elsewhere
 name some shops where you could get 'em from, I'll see if theres one near me
 currys
 Amazon and Play both do it for Â£
 Â£30
 http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sennheiser-PX200-Black-Closed-Headphone/dp/B000089GN4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1252959250&sr=8-1 there's some PX200s for Â£35
 what bonuses does the 200 have over the 100
 I stated the main one
 If you see in the picture, they've got an edge to them, a padded bit around the edge of the headphone
 might get to 200's then
 Fits around the ear and keeps other sound out
 wait what.. rofl
 amazon fail:
 17 new from £18.99 1 used from £30.99
 the new ones are cheaper than used :p
 Yeah, that's a seller that hasn't done his research ;)
 the reviews on these are amazing
 Hey :)
 Hey
 is msn bing retarded for anyone else ?
 Yes
 k
 heh all over facebook "Is it me or is msn being weird?"

 Hey Drazilaustin
 i have a problem. i keep getting an error when i load a page that is pefictly fine
 That's cool
 this is the page http://pastesite.com/10444 and this is the error ( Parse error: syntax error, unexpected ':', expecting ',' or ';' in /www/vndv.com/m/a/z/mazemaker/htdocs/settings.php on line 32)
 bbl
 While you're away Cr`eme, we'll be cracking into your computer.
 i know this is a php page but it is perfectly fine. i fixed the bug but the page still loads the same
 Are you getting that error?
 yes and i replaced the : with a ; like i should have done to begin with but i still get the error
 even when i delete that line since it is just echoing that settings have been chainged
 i continue to load the same thing
 Well on line 32 you've misspelled changed
 i doubt that would cause an error
 I know, Drazilaustin. I was taking the piss :P
 On line 30 you have an extra ' in your query
 Oh wait, no you don't
 i had this problem before with pictures coming out the same even though i chainged them
 Do the username or pw include a : ?
 no
 username should be drail austin
 drazil austin
 let me check the page on my dsi
 the page loads fine on my dsi
 dsi? :/
 but i keep getting the error on my computer
 yes the nintendo DSi gets internet
 Okay.. :/
 Weird child.
 who said i had to be a child to have a dsi
 Nobody did?
 ok then
 Yes.
 what is the problem
 No idea..
 You made it not us.
 it is not the page
 the page is fine it loaded on the dsi
 it is my computer
 O_O
 We can't help you, Drazilaustin. Well, atleast I can't ;)
 it somehow must have saved the page so it loades the bugged one
 Of course.. :/
 I like boobs. 
 What is being sent for autoturn?
 Drazilaustin
 ether on or off
 On or Off? For what?
 it works i used this page before to chainge the settings but i added an echo "your settings have been chainged"; to the page and i used a : instead of a ; and it bugged
 oh epic
 theres acievments now on gmod
 :D:D
 i fixed the bug but it keeps loading as if it was still bugged
 Awesome..
 and it is suposed to set a users settings to on wich lets a player turn in the maze and move or off wich lets the user turn without moving
 Drazilaustin: Did you even make it?
 yes
 it is my maze site
 Maybe you should learn more PHP then? ;)

 to the left and right of these 2 boxes, it's grey
 I'd like it white
 The grey is coming from the menu div below these boxes
 How can I stop this?
 <div id="lightGrayClearfix">
 wonder if that would explain it
 sorry
 <div class="lightGreyBg clearfix">
 aha
 do this
 .clearfix { display: inline }
 get rid of display block
 That may have far reaching effects
 on the rest of the template
 looks fine to me
 in ie6/7/8, ff3.5
 iphone
 grey is still there in chrome
 cache
 doesnt show for me..
 Chrome takes forever to empty cache...
 probably stores a lot
 Emptied cache
 still there
 Need to make header3left and header3right a bit wider
 take off the margin-right on the left one and margin-left on the right one
 so both widths set to 470px
 *480
 actually you don't want grey on edges either i guess... so both widths to 480px and take of margin-left/right on both
 *off
 I thought about that, but that involves messing around with the grid
 There isn't a grid for 480...
 ok then
 ok .lightGreyBG
 *on
 put clear:both;
 and should knock it down
 yep that works 
 just tested
 I love you Dave
 :)
 (That previous statement is nothing to do with the last 5 mins)
 :p
 hahah I hope so too! 
 bah stupid internet
 Rob, the boxes with home/about/services/etc in... I think they should be completely clickable ;)
 Indeed
 Can I just check the a outside the li?
 chuck*
 it might work 
 but really you should set the a to the correct height / width inside the <li>
 hmmm...
 OK
 width has done nothing...
 Evening all :)
 Hello
 Sorry took so long Robert
 http://dave.zymic.com/rob/
 take a look at the first box
 was just playing around with some other things... you should avoid empty divs, etc ;)
 you can set the <span> text to not underline/change colour on hover of course

 Hello
 brb dinner
 While you're away Ben, we'll be cracking into your computer.
 Oh noes

 Oh, don't do anything I wouldn't do Cr`eme
 Pie` I'm actually repaying some money my parents gave me for safe keeping after they sold their house
 So it's not actually MY money :p
 hah
 Still, £28,000 is a lot to pay out...
 Ben want something to play around with?
 http://pastesite.com/10478
 anyone got a rapidshare premium acc i could borrow ?
 I doubt anyone will let you borrow a premium account.
 cheers Sazzad
 Besides Rapidshare tracks the usage of the account. If they notice someone using the account in another country, they will suspend the account.
 Ben: You're welcome
 Sazzad: you'd be suprised
 rapidhsare only care if they get > 15 ips in 2 hours on 1 account
 anything less they don't give a damn, and rapidshare you can secure the account so no settings can be changed, only stuff can be downloaded.
 so its kinda asking to be shared :p
 Mine was suspended because Brandon was using it
 LOL

 Damn YouTube is pissing me off. Their upload system stops at 99%
 haha nice Sazzad!
 Yeah it does that to me too.
 don't bother with debian
 install Ubuntu/Xubuntu
 instead
 I have debian on my server.
 And I like it so far :D
 What's wrong with debian?
 but isn't that shell only ?
 Nothing
 so you don't reall get much of a fell for it
 Of course not
 ^
 Alex: not debian as a whoe
 That's ludicrous :p
 was tlaking about his server :p
 Oh, right, thought you were answering me ;)
 It's a damn sight more stable than the 'buntu family
 I use it through shell and it is good... Think about it having a gui.
 Alex I have COD1 installed again :D
  :O
 Pie`: Is Kubuntu still around?
 ofc
 O_o
 I don't really like new Kubuntu though
 because it uses kde 4, ew
 Heh, nice Ben, with united offensive?
 Brb going to get on Linux
 You mean we have to have you back Cr`eme?
 :P
 Kubuntu has a horrible KDE implementation
 KDE4 is better served elsewhere :p
 yeh, we all installed it on our laptop today and had a lan in costa during our free periods!
 Was good lol
 might as well just install kde 3.5 on Ubuntu
 itd be > kubuntu
 Of course it was, it is one of the kings of FPS, Ben ;)
 Were you a ppsh nub? ;)
 hehe xD
 I got owned on the first game, was getting used to the controls still. After that me and my Thomson were good ;)
 Slackware actually has one of the best KDE4 implementations I've seen now 13.0 is out
 Because Patrick waited until 4.2.4 before including it, and has a policy of not taking any patches that aren't in the official tree (backporting)
 It doesn't have all the horrible cludges the other distros put in in the 4.0 and 4.1 days
 It doesn't change the interface of KDE for no good reason
 The 'buntu folk love messing around with stuff, making headaches for the KDE developers and making KDE less stable on their platform as a result
 It's kinda their thing, not just for KDE but for most large software projects
 Not just them, others do it plenty as well, which is why it gets so bad for the actual developers of the software
 Debian, Fedora, Suse etc are hardly innocent :p
 :D
 'buntu are certainly one of the worst offenders though
 I rarely hear a good thing about ubuntu or kubuntu in #kde from KDE devs
 I have a kiddie version of linux installed T_T
 I mean ubuntu*
 not linux
 lul
 im considerign install gentoo
 I have LinuxMint T_T
 Pie`: you ricer :p
 ??
 "Variations are rice rocket (used mostly but not exclusively for Japanese motorcycles), rice machine, rice grinder or simply ricer. The terms can be targeted at cars which have been modified to give a false impression of high performance, but not actually capable of impressive performance."
 haha
 The Linux community just appropriated the term, because well... it fits ;)
 Gentoo users are like that
 :O
 Always tweaking their build flags to match their hardware perfectly, advocating their favourite gcc optimisation level
 hah
 Does this look ok so far http://grab.by/4xS ? Iv decided i dont want to use Fireworks xD
 I found this good CMS :D
 And they claim to get huge speed out of it
 I tried Gentoo once
 Ben: It is good
 The KDE ebuild was broken so I went with gnome just to get it into a GUI
 And Gnome/Gentoo was the slowest desktop I've ever used :p
 have you ever used Windows Alex? ;)
 Yes
 'cause if you have I doubt Gnome is the slowest :p
 Gnome was slower
 It was intolerable
 I wiped it within a week
 wow Gentoo must suck lol
 cause Ubuntu is super fast compared to XP :p
 I get some people saying "did you try for the best build flags, maybe that was it"
 rofl
 But my response to this is, every other distro uses generic build flags, and they aren't that slow
 How bad are the defaults in Gentoo if they result in this?
 Anyways, if I want fast these days I would go Xfce or stripped-down KDE4
 They're by the numbers lowest performance impact
 But using KDE4 without the glitz would be a bit silly :p
 KDE didn't excite me much
 Kay, it was pretty
 but it was meh
 It was functional ;)
 Once you get up to later 4.2 and 4.3 especially
 Brb again I need to switch O_o
 While you're away Iqbal, we'll be cracking into your computer.
 Gnome annoys me because it lacks ability to customise, it lacks the kind of pervasive support for things like drag-and-drop that KDE is known for
 And GTK+ has some of the most horrible dialogs known to man
 The GTK+ file open dialog is almost worth boycotting the whole toolkit over
 It's so stupid and unusable
 I like it ;)
 Does it still have the thing where if you type in "/us" to get /usr
 It auto-completes down to /usr/src
 idk, I've never tried it ;)
 Because that kind of idiocy in the auto completion is so annoying
 but whats the point in typgin /us and then trying to autocomplete
 surely its further to the tab key than it is to the r
 It's a demonstration of the problem
 It auto completes without user interaction
 It's not just in that case that it happened
 Any time the first letter could auto complete without ambiguity and the same for the second letter inside that dir
 You had to backtrack on yourself because it had tried to be too clever for its boots
 Back
 Does anyone know how to setup VNC onto a linux system... Last time I tried it I had a rought time :<
 sudo apt-get install vnc? :}
 yum install vnc?
 :o
 Reall
 :s
 wait, I tihnk that might be sudu
 ;)
 :{
 w/e
 there were loads of people online on COD1 earlier
 If you see any tagged "rifle-only", join, Ben ;)
 Prepare to get your ass handed to you
 haha id get owned though :(
 M1A1 = rifle ?
 carbine
 Not usually
 yup
 dam
 In terms of CoD1 you get Kar98k or Mousin
 Looks like ill have to practise with the springfield then
 If they allow scoped that is
 Ok Kar98k it is ;)
 Some do some don't
 I'll get good at it Alex, you will see ;)
 The Lee Enfield is sometimes allowed
 Despite its annoying reload it's got the power to compete with the other two
 The Garand or the M1A1 are too puny
 M1A1 = win :D
 he
 I was using that the the Thomson earlier
 The M1A1 is just a pistol that holds 30 a clip :p
 It's a good gun ;)
 woot
 im the 322nd viewer of the newest sxephil video :D
 I think ill practise on the Thomson first before i move ot file only matches
 Not to hard to get passable with that kind of weapon
 When you see someone drop prone and burst fire :p
 yeh good tactic ;)
 Provided you're not standing in the open somewhere
 In which case prone is not really a good plan
 I dont like how you have to click to aim then click again to go back to normal.
 It becomes second nature :p
 You stop thinking about it
 I hope so :)
 How are you liking the fact you can lean? ;)
 Haven't tried that actually
 Q and E
 I just did the basics, run, jum and shoot
 I think i shall have a go at that tomorrow Alex thanks, sounds good hehe
 If you go around a corner without first clipping it with a lean in rifle only.... ;)
 It can end badly
 Shall we say
 hah... css jumping and firing doesnt work on cod
 hehe this sounds like a good tactic Alex
 In some situations it's your only option, JaXm
 But if they can get command of the corner before you
 NSFW: http://www.phillyd.tv/wp-content/uploads/megan-fox5.jpg
 I mean, well if they have command of the corner before you that's your only sane option
 If you don't know if they're there, or if there's someone coming along around watching that corner
 so what gun did you mainly use Alex ?
 Gotta go
 C'ya guys and girls
 I was fine with either the kar or the mousin
 I preferred the nagant for the sight
 But can't say it made much difference to my play
 Unscoped typically in both cases
 Though I did sometime play matches where scoped was allowed, it depended on the map
 oooh nice
 So you was a bit of a rifle whore? ;)
 What's the name of the map with the two houses, fields, hedges and the crashed plane
 Bocage?
 That one was a scoped map, long open corridors with holes from shells for cover along them
 You'd still roam, no one's thick enough to camp
 Not sure we only played 1 map
 Not when everyone knows the camping spots
 Harbor or Railyard?
 hehe
 Those are my favourites :p
 No, it wouldn't be
 You were American
 It was a smallish one, lots of houses everywhere and cars
 heh if i ever camp... ill pick a spot where i can pick off the people checking for those camping spots :P
 That would be... oh damn starts with a c
 Carentan
 I quite like that map too
 substitute the more covered positions for the surprise factor
 Yeah, being a rifle user that was what I did in team deathmatch when I wasn't roaming :p
 For example, carentan that you played Ben
 yeh
 You know there's a house that has an german machine gun placement in the window?
 Yeh
 my mate was like ben pick it up, i was like its fixed to the window...
 haha
 haha
 There's a spawn point in the field opposite that window
 I always went German, got my kar98k
 aha you sly badger Alex ;)
 Cycled towards the left edge to where you can see the window
 I got very good at that shot ;)
 yea, they usually only check quick to see if theres someone AT the machine gun... never notice anyone sitting NEAR it
 lol bet some people were annoyed
 People tended to leave that placement alone after a little while
 The other one is a bit more troublesome because it's harder to stay out of sight of the placement reliably before you take your shot
 But you head over to where the boxes are on the other corner of the map
 And lean clip to get the headshot
 Behind the boxes, NOT behind the wall in front
 It's way to easy to get surprised by a roaming machine-gunner if you take the wall
 Im going to try these tomorrow lol
 too easy*
 The thing is though, that placement gunner is always looking for someone to go into the house that's opposite and take a shot from the window
 I don't know why, as if I'm going to be that predictable ;)
 hehe
 The place I've got it's fairly safe, if I didn't kill them it was because some roamer caught me occupied or because he dropped the placement and left
 The placement gunner doesn't have a hope in hell unless my "d" key stuck ;)
 wow
 in the CoD:MW2 collectors edition, you get night vision goggles
 lol
 It's also £120 :p
 And £55 for just the game >_>
 games are getting stupidly expensive
 £44 on play.com
 I remember when you could get games for £10
 brand new like
 Hooray for bulk buys getting the RRP down :p
 out for a week 
 If you want some maps to look out for though, Ben, definitely look for Harbor and Railyard they're nice
 ahh ok cheers
 Stalingrad, Pavlov, Brecourt Bocage and sometimes Rocket are good
 Chateau is a shit map ;)
 Neuville can be shit or mediocre
 haha im going to get lost on them :(
 Ship is fairly poor
 Powcamp has too many campers
 oh thank god
 hah good name for it then
 Assassinc's creed 2 will have different structures for the missions to AC 1
 Hurtgen is pot luck because you can be seen all over the place, so it can be too camped as well
 AC1 all the missions were the same, jsut a different map et
 c
 You're only just finding these things out, Pie`?  That's out soon ;)
 Heh :p
 I am especially knowledgable about harbor :p
 I know exactly what happens after a team start
 aha
 Where's safe, where to stop, where they will be watching
 Alex: did you ever finish AC 1?
 useful :)
 Yup, I did Pie`
 what actually happens in the parts not inside the missions
 I've not finished it yet, but I've got to the part where the assasins find out that theyre doing stuff witht he guy
 what happens after that?
 Where you're in the near future?
 yeah
 That's a setup for the last game I think
 It's nothing much
 Just a bit of plot
 Mmk
 I'm gonna go to bed now
 nn Zymic
 Do you want the plot?  I can give a brief synopsis from memory
 lol
 Dammit Windows 7, stop going to sleep mode
 This was #java
 Yeah, I can imagine similar reasons there :p
 Java isn't really seen as a "guru" language, so they overcompensate ;)
 What's the point in an enum? D:
 I really don't see the point in them
 or at least, not in Java
 They're a simple structure to define a range of values in constant-like fashion
 Makes it easy to have a simple sequential list
 Alex, put me out of my misery... How do I tell a string the following is a single character encoded in ASCII hecadecimal?
 I can't find it anywhere
 I know it's something like \0A3 ?
 or \0xA3
 Alex: wouldn't it jsut be easier to create a bunch of final values?
 less code involed
 I don't see how it would be less code, Pie`
 an enum in java you declare the enum whatever {
 then you could ahve something like
 aValue(2);
 Does it need a "\" in Java for hexadecimal?  You could try some casting to char
 private int value;
 public whatever(int value) {
 this.value = value;
 when you could ahve just declared, public static final int value = 2;
 http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/enums.html
 Sun's explanation
 Gives an example of an emum
 enum Season { WINTER, SPRING, SUMMER, FALL }
 That's four things defined in one line
 So I don't really know what you're doing :p
 take a look at the enum Planet example
 What about it, the actual defining of constants is still shorter
 But because it acts as a class it can be more flexible (and somewhat messier to my mind) than just holding values
 Planet(double mass, double radius) {
 But you could use an enum that just had the values in it
 you wouldn't need that if it were just some final ints
 Alex, you can create a constructor for an enum and make fields/methods in them
 They've done that because it makes the rest of the functionality shorter, Pie`
 and to call the instructor; WINTER(1) etc.
 constructor****888888
 ...right, well, no one was questioning that as far as I can see, and that was clear from the documentation, but thanks
 The thing is, you don't /need/ to provide that stuff
 An enum can exist fine without constructors, methods
 that's what pie` was trying to explain from what i read...
 obv, just as a class can
 And in such cases, it's no longer than the Season enum I gave earlier
 But you can make it more complicated to reduce overall code length via code reuse
 Typical OOP
 If adding a constructor/methods etc adds in unneeded complication then you wouldn't use them obviously
 So I don't see your argument for enums being "longer" than final ints as a helpful measure of quality, Pie`
 And dispute that it's even necessarily the case
 ..noob
 i agree with you there, Alex 
 you you only need one instonce of them constants are the way tho go
 tireddd
 Mufia, can u code
 only in Java, C, C++, VB and python
 can u code xml
 ...
 ?
 Sync`, are you tired?
 Alex, ur noob lol!
 no
 Dolleh Musics NOW!
 HOMG D:
 lemme go on msn kay
 kai
 ooooo I might know a song ben might like
 old one tho
 ooh :O
 What one?
 Alex I tried that leaning today! :D
 Sync`: what?
 Ben: nice, how did it go? :p
 noob
 I found the linux installers for CoD1 just now, mirrors were down yesterday, couldn't get onto them
 It actually worked lol, played the same map as yesterday. I was on some corner and leaned around and saw my mate so shot him xD
 ahh that sucks :(
 Seems to be up today
 Think I'll upload them to my server after this :p
 So I don't need to find them again
 hehe nice :D
 Sync`: got anything interesting to say or should I assume that's about it?
 ur dumb
 Be quiet now
 l2code
 noob
 and goto school cuz ur dumb
 rly dumb
 rofl, there are airballoons in the air, hmm 20 of them, my cat is scared shit and sissing at it lolll
 lol
 Why are you surprised that leaning works anyways, Ben :p
 I never worked out why it wasn't in later FPS games
 Seems kinda obvious that it's useful
 Yeh its good :D
 haha yeh, i worked out that bursts of fire only work when your close to the person xD
 You can get away with it from further with a BAR or similar
 But with a Thompson, yeah :p
 Yeh the weapon just goes out of control. i have to do small bursts
 may try a rifle only game lapter after i start and finish my essay ;)

 That was well... RANDOM
 ahah yeh
 Whenever you want to play a bit of mp_harbor, tell me, Ben ;)
 I can find a server, you know how to connect given an IP:port I assume?
 Because I've not got xfire or any of that shit :p
 ahh ok :) Have to finish this essay first.
 Urm nope but im sure i can find out easily
 On the main menu bring down the console and /connect ip:socket
 IIRC
 ahh ok :)
 Already found an empty clan harbor/rifle-only server, that'd do :p
 Punkbuster usually works, I should make sure in advance though
 haha sweet
 I should be done with this essay in 1-2 hours, so if your up for a game then, then you better get the tissues ;)
 What port?
 Wooo Grapes!
 Great Pie` you scared off Ed
 for about 2 minutes, yeah :D
 Pie` Can you give me some quick java help?
 Sure
 To explain how to do something or why I can't?
 1 sec, let me paste
 thanks ;)
 Welcome
 http://pastesite.com/plain/10500
 not great with 2d arrays
 but why not just use an ArrayList?
 Because I've never heard of them?
 wait, will you be adding more things to the Map key ?
 or is that all that is going in the slot
 Yes
 Not to that key, not
 There will be more added to the map
 you might as well just use an arraylist then
 java.util.ArrayList
 ArrayList<Object> arrayListName = new ArrayList<Object>();
 ps, Object can be anything
 Integer, String, boolean, etc etc
 I just put Object incase there was anything other than Integer's going into the map key
 also, why did you use a 2d array if all you were going to put in it was 1 thing ?
 Because other entries will have more
 you could use an ArrayList instead of a hashmap, unless it is important for you to have the String keys
 ArrayList<Integer[]>
 It is
 http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html
 Already on that :p
 Ah, yes
 It's been solved
 In a notice, not entirely sure why
 Does the mysterious benefactor mind being named for some reason?
 wut D:
 I'm going to say thank you Sync`
 <Sync` whispers>types.put("Safety Margin", new int[][] {{0, -1, 3}});
 That's what I was after
 but then if you aren't going to change the values of that key in the map, what's the point in the 2d array ?
 types.put("random key", new int[][] {{6475, 8195, 10}, {8195, 41075, 20}, {41075, -1, 40});
 is the next one
 Thus the 2d arrays
 When I get each value I'm foreaching over them
 Bonus points for anyone who recognises those numbers and guesses what I'm writing
 They're quite important numbers in the UK...
 is it grid co-ordinates for UK
 or um
 long/lat position
 or something related to those topics
 No
 A long way off
 because I googled the numbers and thats all it came out with O_o
 the 10, 20, 40 are together as a set
 Then the others go in order with -1 a placeholder for infinity
 Hello
 I have no idea then Robert :P
 Do you have a job?
 Nope
 Anyone want to finish my essay of for me ?
 Then these numbers don't yet apply to you
 Ben, on what?
 But they will soon Pie` :p
 hah
 Geography, "To what extent is it possible to manage population change?"
 what are they? ;)
 Tax bands
 I'm learning Java for a job interview tomorrow for a job I don't think I want
 lol
 So thought I might as well make something useful
 Robert: http://uppit.com/v/SZ6PCH0Q
 that's what I've been working on :P
 What?
 Ok
 Started looking into the Graphics class
 it says 0MB
 its uh
 small
 3.6kb
 It needs to have variable directions and speeds
 Otherwise, a good start - far better than I could do atm!
 I hate graphics and GUI's...
 Robert2, if you wanna make a GUI, get neatbeans
 it has a WYSIWYG editor, whcih is highly useful
 I did get netbeans, couldn't work it out
 spent too long finguring out the IDE, and not enough time writing
 I only use it when I want an APP with a UI
 because I really don't understand Swing layouts etc
 C# is Java for fools ;)
 is C# free?
 Yep
 Pie` - how do I get a £ symbol?
 you hold shift and press 3? D:
 I'm currently using NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance()
 and it returns some wierd u with an accent
 So does £ in a string
 idk, lol
 I've never used £ in a string
 I'm surprised the CurrencyInstance is messing up

 Alex_ you here?
 Not bad ;)
 Right im off for a game of COD1 whoooooooooooo!!

 Going to try this zombie mod lol xD
 Zombie mode is fun
 Which map you going to play?
 yeh! I have all the zombie maps on cod5, but im playing the first ever cod1 now with a zombie mod so don't know what map xD
 I like the newest zombie map on cod5, upgrade weapons FTW!

 Is it that time of the month? ;)
 nope ;D sorry have to dissapoint you
 bah
 just family pissed me off :P
 I see
 plus its so hard to keep this damn tape on
 it has to stay on til 7 o'clock, and I have naturally sweaty feet & hands :p
 hands off the tape :P
 well I need to remember to take it off at the right time
 because my brother's friend hand the same treatment on his feet
 and he left it on too long and it ate his foot
 XD
 now its all black and such on the bottom
 I threathed a wart on my friends hand once, she screamed so loud in my ear I couldn't hear shit for 1 hour
 hah
 with what? liquid nitrogen?
 or did you just pop it with a needle? :p
 yep, nitrogen ftw
 aaah
 if i'd pop it with a needle... she'd kill me by now
 I had the choice between nitrogen and the beetle venom
 nitrogen isn't that bad!
 should have choose nitrogen really :P
 so I picked the later, since I have so many fucking warts
 nitrogen FTW TO...
 There's too many for nitrogen Dolleh
 there's 25 total...
 still I would have picked nitrogen XD
 that would've hurt like a mofo
 hah!
 This should finally shut those macheads up

 I think it would go well on the front page of my website :D
 I really think its the other chemical tho TO, cause it causes necrosis, wich can turn skin black hehe :P
 ah

 Why? :(
 well Dolleh it did turn the one guy's skin black

 I use eclipse for it :P

 ew Notepad++
 lol
 or plain notepad
 i use both
 I used NP++ for a while
 its just a clunky colourful version of Notepad
 i like the syntax highlighting though
 i wasnt thinking, when i made the login, to have it hide the boxes
 i use context for php, because the highlighting is nicer than notepad++'s
 Ben: what's it gonna do? lol
 This http://grab.by/4J0 for windows
 Im making the user controls now
 ah cool
 gonna hve ti like run a crontab every so often? looking for updates?
 its strange, it was easier to make a user control in vb6 which is a really old language than in vb.net
 Yep
 surely if you make it in .NEt people will have tod ownload the framework? D:
 well, a newer version fo teh framework
 http://grab.by/4J1
 because IIRC, xp+ comes with .NET 2.0
 Pie` I always use .NET Framework 2.0 with my projects
 mmmm
 I change it to that
 <3 cgitb
 not all xp comes with 2.0 but most do
 if you make ti in a real language you could support all computers
 Pie`, no crontabs in Windows
 TheOracle: not a crontab as such
 but the same sorta idea
 ah

 So basically you will just be using there product and changing the name
 Write me an app CSS_Guru that creates random strings? :D
 ;)
 I could probably do one in an hour or so
 Probably less
 for what Rob
 i do projects that i wanna do.
 hahahah
 i dont code for other people sorry
 I've never used C++ before
 Come on, its 1 line of code for me.
 CSS_Guru it would take you seconds ;)
 u probly learn off google
 Result is: CSS_Guru is full of shit and just using a base app.
 Yep
 im not using any base app lol, thats pathetic
 Write me smoe code now then

 Alex: is it worth me intalling Xubuntu over Ubuntu ?
 Do you want an ecosystem aimed towards Xfce?
 Wut :P
 That's the only real difference
 Ubuntu bores me
 because it's turning into firefox
 heavy, clunky, slow
 Xubuntu is an edition of Ubuntu aimed to have all the tools running nicely in an Xfce Desktop Environment
 Rather than Gnome as is default in Ubuntu
 Or KDE in Kubuntu
 hi people
 Is there any page for hosting details, where you can see things like that?
 We have 5 possible subdomains to register on
 No, no...
 These are, 99k.org, zxq.net, zzl.org, zymichost.com and clanteam.com
 No there's no where as yet to see these details
 I mean like if my domain is hello.com, can i ad a subdomain, so my visitors can go to a page called login.hello.com
 ?
 Yes, 2 of these are available.
 Okay
 Is there any pre-installed scripts, like FormMail?
 Not at the moment, no miguel1234, we don't offer outgoing mail by default either. This is offered for a one off $10 charge.

 why would i use js for that? lol

 could do with css :D

 hasting, Zymic's nickserv?
 Ed, I assume not, that would be somewhat going over the top with exaggeration to say ten minutes :p
 He logged on at :24 made an ident request some time after that (don't know exactly when), and was identified at :41
 Bullet time ;)
 Makes it a maximum of 17 seconds if the ident request reached the server in the same second he joined, but it's hard to really say when it did
 That said looking at the other people who logged on at similar times the maximum time period is more like 2-3 seconds
 So one suspects it's on his end

 I take it you don't work anymore.. then? :p
 Lovely but expensive ;)
 And availability is still fairly limited
 I'm back in Cardiff Brandon

 Nope, never.

 If looking at a screen bothers you, perhaps it's not a good idea ;)
 go have a lie down
 But, then I'll get fat laying down.. where as if I'm typing I wont get that much fat (rofl).
 I may have fixed it, just need Dave to check (as I don't have IE7...)
 I have IE5..
 Wow...
 Visit www.thatcode.com ?
 How is it different to it in something good?
 Oh, I mean.. I have Safari.
 Not too impressive, ies4linux installs 5, 5.5 and 6 :p
 If you want it to
 Also beta support for ie7
 Generally something looks off in IE5, but who cares :p
 Anyone still using it is probably safely in a market segment you can ignore
 But if it doesn't, it's probably fine in all browsers
 I'm not that worried about IE6 even :p
 Well, the share for that is certainly withering away
 It's still worth thinking about I'd say, but you don't need to make it perfect for that group
 Anyway, the problem is solved
 Just added a position: relative;, and some HUGE white boxes disappeared
 Someone explain this? http://browsershots.org/screenshots/7a3733c60133ef2ea799333e3a606b8c/

 real, low resolution though I think
 Eww.
 I can't wait for it to come back :P. I don't want it to come back like Prison Break then have two shows and that was it..
 That really annoyed me :(
 Never saw Prison Break
 It was awesome imo.
 always looking for a new show to watch though.. finished The Wire the other week
 Never seen that
 hey all
 The Mentalist looks pretty cool.
 pyDelphi: tell Robert I'll look into it
 TheOracle: I'll pass that on when Robert is around.
 there's that new show "Flashforward" out soon, that looks good
 TheOracle I'm right here...
 Robert: 04:07 PM UTC <TheOracle> tell Robert I'll look into it
 oh sorry haha
 Was that about unicode?
 Yea, for some reason I am using ASCII for the log stream...
 Yes, I seen the advert Mark2.. looks pretty cool :)
 I'll take a look ;)
 Well Robert its not making the error anymore

 It's not
 however its not writing it to the file correctly
 ...

 Maybe I need to encode the string last-minute, I'll try that
 That didn' work either
 Well I've solved it by stripping it form the stream, only a temp fix :/

 talking about outlet's VPS kev
 i wonder if andrews vps expired.. it was a trial for like a month from lunar

 lol
 no-FTP
 kevin: I doubt they would take it down so seriously
 so suddenly*
 Dunno why I said seriously
 they might have given him a notice or something
 eh
 o well nothing I can do
 just will have to wait :P
 if both Andrew & outlet's VPS is down its more than likely a datacenter problem
 ya
 my sites all seem to be up
 they may be having problems with their connectivity
 ya
 any one have safari?
 kevin do you know the name of the host?

 thanks for the help robert
 That's fine
 I didn't do much...
 haha ya but you pointed out the issue ;)
 which helped me solve lol
 He wants sex now, Robert. Have fun ;)
 So he'll go for you first
 I doubt it :p
 I can run pretty fast :O
 Zymic i have srs question for you
 !!1!1!!!!!!1
 I can do alot of things.. really fast :o
 what could be a possible cause for my pipe key not working ?
 (Shift + backslash)
 my bakslash works
 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
 but pipe doesn't
 pipe?
 shift+back slash
 | Brandon
 its like, vertical line
 ?
 ??
 ???/
 ||
 |||||||||
 ^ that
 mine doesn't work
 it doesn't do anything
 That, but only 1 of them
 it's a really important key too :p
 Pie`: Possible liquid pollution?
 no Brandon
 Are you sure..
 because for the 3rd tiem, backslash still works
 Could be anything ;)
 which is on the same key
 backslash + pipe are the same key
 just pipe is shift + that key
 Oh, yes.. yours is the same key xD
 k, so
 I've come to the conclusion its a software problem
 and I'm 100% sure fo that
 Must be.
 I've got 2 keyboards plugged in
 neither can do pipe ;)
 Lol.
 You suck.
 I've gotta have 2 in though
 Why?
 1 of them is semi-broken, the other is a USB keyboard
 and I have to go through GRUB on boot
 Muppet.
 USB isn't started on boot :p
 Go in to BIOS
 I tried that
 and enable the USB
 USB is enabled
 Erm..
 It's called "Legacy USB Support" ensure that's enabled.
 And "USB 2.0 Support" and "USB Controller" :p
 But mainly "Legacy USB Support"
 I only have a USB keyboard, and it works fine
 And yes, I do have a boot password
 ...
 Why are you telling us you have a boot password? x'D.
 Easily removable :)
 Really?
 By flashing the BIOS?
 By removing the CMOS battery..
 And flashing it but... the boot password tends to stop that :p
 I'm just hoping the "Really?" was just sarcasm.. ;)
 lolo
 bios stuff is kinda pointless
 Yes.
 well, security related bios settings
 so easily reset ;)
 Yep.
 ok so zymic I've come to the conclusion the world is going to end
 in 2010
 NOT 2012
 how
 Pie`
 because of standard british number plates
 the 3rd and 4th digits
 the 3rd digit, is either a 0 or a 5
 5 represets the car was amde in the 2nd half fo the year
 0 means 1st half
 then the 4th digit is the last number of the year
 7 means 2007, 8 means 2008
 etc
 what about 2010?
 what are they gonna do then ?!??!!?!
 Ah.
 Clever.
 Sounds like an apocalypse to me ;)
 epic :D
 http://bash.org/?903176
 Its pending atm
 http://grab.by/5bl
 Pie` 1 or 6
 Robert, what ?
 Robert: 0 & 5 would be equal to 1 & 6
 00, 50, 01, 51, ..... 09, 59, 10, 60, 11, 61
 Oh
 well you guys are screwed either way :p
 Why?
 I stand by what I said
 :D
 just to throw everyone off about 2012
 Because, what would the plate number be for 2012?
 er, 2010
 Robert is probably right
 Because a 0 at the end would signify 2000, right?
 it'd be 10/60
 currently its 00/50
 whcih would represet 2000
 if you make it 10/60 
 Ah
 that could 2010
 no, a 0 at the end signifies a year ending in 0
 I need a rly big dictionary file :L
 ?
 Use the Oxford English Dictionary then :p
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plates_of_the_United_Kingdom#Age_identifiers
 no, it'd be for an ric bot or something
 I was right
 Markov, Pie`?
 no, spell checker
 Ah
 maybe GNU Aspell then
 there's an epic function in PHP, levenshtein()
 http://uk2.php.net/manual/en/function.levenshtein.php
 http://aspell.net/
 you give it 2 strings
 it works out how many operations it would take to convert 1 string into the ther
 :<
 the aspell dictionary files ahve some weird formatting on them
 has stuff like:
 'snis'sesra'se'se'sne'srea'snalin
 bleh, can't say it here
 irc thinks im trying to supply a colour
 hah
 Why are you NOTICEing me, Pie`?
 You know I don't take such actions fondly.
 showing you what I can't paste here :D
 Why not just do an explicit /msg #zymic? :/
 becayse #zymic Color is not permitted in this channel (#zymic)?
 How does your client think "'snis'sesra'se'se'sne'srea'snalin" is a colour set?
 It must be very poor.
 its the irc, not my client
 'snis'sesra'se'se'sne'srea'snalin
 :/
 Its obviously your client, then.
 that's with the odd characters missing
 Well why didn't you just remove the weird characters, then put it in the channel?
 Or take a screenshot of them?

 hahaha, i love russell howard ;)
 I've already got this site going
 Robert: who mananges things like this: http://www.zymic.com/tutorials/php/creating-a-file-upload-form-with-php/
 Anyone who has access?
 because the file extension thing
 could be a bit buggy
 It's fairly static, but I suppose Ed and Jack
 Which one?
 substr($filename, strpos($filename,'.'), strlen($filename)-1);
 And why?
 if the filename has > 1 .
 eg, file.image.jpg
 the extension would be image.jpg
 you would want to use strrpos
 instead of strpos
 strrpos returns the last occurence
 I'd call that a non allowed extension...
 So it's still OK
 but .jpg is still the file extension
 I'd write that to reject if it's slightly dodgy, which that does
 Ed
 Arbitrate
 but adding 1 extra character
 fixed the entire problem
 I'll change it if Ed says so
 Hi everybody
 echo substr("file.image.jpg", strpos("file.image.jpg",'.'), strlen("file.image.jpg")-1);
 gives you: .image.jpg
 Pie` I know what you're going on about
 just making sure ;)
 I'm just not sure allowing file.image.jpg is a good idea, if you're only after an image file
 but .jpg is still the file extension
 I know
 everything else is taken as the file name
 But the file is slightly wierd because of it
 And those tutorials are written for ANYONE
 Lots of people just copy the code
 So they're quite harsh on what they let through
 While we're on this subject...
 What do you think would be good topics for a tutorial?
 I have a request for Zymic webhosting administrator please
 Someone please tel me who could help me ?
 CERT-LEXSI, Ed can.
 thx

 Windows 7 isn't bad at all :/
 yeah it is
 its below xp
 Have you tried it?
 but only just
 yes, i have 
 Pics or it didn't happen.
 i uninstalled it because it was too shitty
 but I still have the bootloader on here
 You can't judge an entire OS by testing it for an hour, Pie`.
 It was on here for 3 months
 You used it for three months?
 Or did it sit there for that long?
 I used it
 it was, OK
 it was worse than XP
 but only just
 What was bad?
 far far better than vista
 I found it rather clunky
 they spend too much on aesthetics
 not enough on performance
 Anyone here do C or C++ and fancy a chance of about $20?
 http://www.scriptlance.com/projects/1253488981.shtml
 It performs rather nicely on my computer, and I only have a GB or RAM.
 of*
 I know it's easy, but I don't do the language...
 I found XP out performed 7
 By how much?
 a bit
 That isn't very descriptive.
 That could mean a lot or a little.
 its inbetween
 a lot and a little
 it wasn't a little
 but ti wasn't a lot
 it was, a bit
 Well, I could've swore you were just being influenced by anti-Microsoft propaganda.
 Believe me, I don't like them a whole lot.
 But they did pretty damn well this time, compared to Vista and XP, to me atleast.
 It's a LOT better than vista, I'll give you that
 vista was just utter trash
 Only time will tell whether anti-Microsoft bullshit or people who actually try it takes over
 ChromeOS will sway that judgement
 it's either going to be a huge success
 or an epic fail
 Well, coming from Google, you have to expect success...
 If they fail then that can ruin them
 but I think they're being over ambitious
 Indeed,
 they say they're going to take UNIX and completley strip it back
 build it form the groud up, fixing anything that doesn't work properly
 I don't like the idea of Cloud-OSes very much though.
 or is flawed
 Doesn't seem to have the same security.
 is windows 7 released?
 well, I'm gonna hit the hay
 No
 nn Zymic !
 okey good

 There are times when I hate chrome
 Its view source is one of them
 Chrome is great if you want a minimalist browser that's just as resource heavy as the rest of them
 It's much faster than any thing else

 Excellent, carry on

 Opinions http://grab.by/5j8  we had to make a site in IT at school, I didn't like the fact we had to use fireworks so used photoshop :)
 hahaha ... thank you all ... I feel respected here ...
 It's just a rule to keep chat to English in the channel, foreign language discussions are encouraged to be held in PM or #zymic-[country code]
 Ben is that your school?
 Cr`eme it's my school work, were doing flash atm but im just working on that in my free periods.
 Oh ok]
 well most the time, the other time im playing COD1 in Costa with everyone xD
 lol
 Just a policy to keep this channel to a lingua-franca we can all work with, foreign languages are perfectly fine on the network :p
 Not sure those two sentences will translate well
 But let's hope so ;)
 Mibbit is good for translating.
 Yeah ;)
 Get first EMA payment on Friday Whoooooooooo! :D
 That looks good, Ben, I'm sure it'll be hilariously better than what others come up with :p
 At least that's my experience of this sort of thing, and I can't even really design
 Not properly, I can merely colour co-ordinate, which means it doesn't look /bad/ it just looks bland :p
 The kind of stuff you see done in schools though, make your eyes bleed
 Thanks Alex, I don't design either I just want my site to look half decent. Looking round the room the other day, some of the stuff I saw and when the teacher said "You lot really have the hang of web design" just me eww
 Different area, but powerpoint presentations are horrible for that
 hmmmm ... I'm sleepy ... here at 3 am ... what time there? I sleep so ...
 haha ye Alex
 For chemistry A2 at one point, we split into groups to make power point presentations on the subject of light based spectroscopy
 Hey Alex 
 And not one but two of the four groups (not mine, I insisted on doing ours, in a packaged theme) decided it would be a good idea to (get this):
 Make the background a diagonal rainbow, and then make the text word art with a different direction of rainbow
 Rainbow on rainbow
 Can you imagine the horror?
 lmao haha xD
 I don't think I want to ;)
 I just wonder, are these people blind?
 This wasn't really a subtle problem :p
 to find all ...
 yeh i think the same
 Everony in my IT class has a site like this http://login.rbwm.org/~stouj001/  using tables, flash buttons, blank background and not center.
 Oooh, a marquee
 That brings back memories
 Horrible memories ;)
 haha ;) yep people have marquees, they didn't understand the concept of the code when the teacher said we had to use code to put it in.
 I can see they've done a spectacular job of cutting out those football boot images as well
 You can barely see that white edge all over the place
 But I suppose we can't expect too much
 haha ;)
 `ping
 PONG
 lol Steve 
 That site was one of the chavs that said on our first lesson "how do you make a folder" ;)
 At one point in that he is four nested tables deep
 For a site that simple
 I'm surprised to see the code is indented sensibly
 Thats how we are taught Alex.
 Dreamweaver does the indenting Alex ;)
 Oh right, how irritating
 the only bit of code he did was the marquee
 I hate IDEs that try to indent for me
 haha yeh
 It never does it how I want it to
 I don't like the predicted thing in dreamweaver, its annoying.
 So you're going to be sensible about that website then, Ben
 One div, and all the rest as semantic tags
 Yes, going to use html/css
 By the looks
 Course :)
 h1 for the header, h2 for the text "Ben Thomson" etc... :)
 ul li for the nav :D
 only 1 div for the container
 Depending on how the footer area ends up that could be the only div, and it'll be a lot easier to work with :p
 You might confuse your teacher somewhat though
 aha I dont think they look at the code.
 I suppose not, since it's auto-generated, hard to mark the rest as anything but a fail
 Although the thing is the browser at school is IE7, so might have to use some Javascript for the rounded corners or some css.
 Rounded corners at the top are easy enough to put into the navigation
 Yeh would have to use 1 big image though, was gong to just repeat it. Although for ease ill probs use a  big image
 No, don't see the need for a big image
 How else ? 3 images ?
 Put the navigation inside the container div, and have the container div as a 1px wide repeat background which gives that top background
 ul has the right corner as a background
 never worked with rounded corners before apart from css3
 First li has the left corner plus the graph
 ahh Alex your magic! Thanks :D
 You certainly can't sensibly use CSS3 stuff yet in public work
 and have the header outside of the div ?
 Yes
 Unless you're a website for a specific browser group in the set that implement CSS3, which you rarely are
 Yeh I was just experimenting with it the other day.
 You can use bits and pieces but only where it doesn't matter if it's not recognised
 We just have to make sure it works in IE7 with the same reso as the school computers
 I use a bit of text-shadow around the place
 Looks a bit nicer on compliant browsers, still looks fine on others
 Yeh, I like text-shadow :)
 You would define the width of the container by centering the <body> tag as the main block container
 Which makes positioning the header relative to the rest easy
 Then just have the container div as a full-width white box with that background at the top repeat-x
 SO align the body to center ?
 I normally just use margin: 0 auto; on the container and have everythig inside that.
 Yes, html, body { margin: 0 auto; padding: 0; } body { width: whatever; }
 Done
 I have to groan when people have <body><div id="container"> when they could have just made body do what the container is there for :p
 Wasteful
 ooh cheers
 html can be used as a canvas as well, you see divs used to place page backgrounds as well
 Is it worth using a reset stylesheet like this http://pastesite.com/10553  ?
 And they don't realise they could put that page background on html or body, or if there are two composite images to it they can use both
 i have put a background on a body before hehe :)
 To be honest, I don't use anything quite so resetting as those, though I suppose I could :p
 I tend to use a really basic one that just resets margin/padding to 0
 yeh, i spose thats all i really need for the layout i made.
 I could use something like that I guess, I've just never seen that it makes it significantly easier than * { margin: 0; padding: 0; }
 If you really want to work from a blank canvas, then you can use a reset like that
 hmm i dont think id really need it, ill see how it goes when i code it.
 too much alex and ben here OMH
 I'm sorry about that, Dolleh, silly of me
 ahah
 I should have asked you your opinion, do you recommend a complex css reset? ;)
 I don't want you to feel left out
 hmm I think i'm going to make tea instead, continue geeking! I go for the tea... yeah

 fine, 2 sugars, but you WON'T get a spoon!

 sorry
 We're not here all the time, we have better things to do

 im sorry
 And we're all unpaid, so it's not like any of us have to be here anyway
 i know man
 Anyway, what do you want?
 unpaid 
 that sucks
 i just want too know if zymic is a good hosting service
 Well, tbh you've come to the wrong place to ask that
 As we're all kind of biased!
 haha
 i supose so
 But yes, we think it's good, and lots of our users do too
 is it a secure service security wise?
 We don't support SSL
 ok...
 So for your clients, you can't use https
 and SQLi wise?
 However, for the backend, we send updates to our panel providers, and they listen.

 Hey
 hey Ben
 was thinking today, why don't microsoft make Windows like linux a bit in the way it can't get viruses that do loads of damage ?
 ...
 Is that sarcastic Ben?
 Nah serious
 You do know why linux people don't get viruses don't you?
 Although I suppose it would affect a few companies like anti-virus software
 Not really, is it something to do with sudo ?
 It's nothing to do with Microsoft writing bad code
 I never said they did ;)
 If you're doing something to scam a lot of people, in any field, spam e-mail, spam snail mail, cold calling ect, there are a few universal rules
 1) target those who don't know enough to stop you
 so noobs
 2) target the majority, as you'll get more people
 Windows fits both of those
 Linux gets no viruses because no-one bothers to write them
 Most viruses are targeted at Windows simply because it has the majority market share
 Yeh I know that, but I swear someone said you can't get viruses on linux that can do that much damage
 There's nothin Windows can do about that unless they lose market share, which is hardly gong to happen
 It may be more locked down, I don't know much about that
 But i'm sure this is the main reason
 hmm ok
 Time for a reformat I thinks
 Why?
 I have a virus xD
 Just need to do some big backup and should be good to go
 Just don't back up the virus :p
 I wont, just doing my school work and projects.
 Morning Ed
 Afternoon :P
 2 screens is wierd...
 Taking some getting used to
 Don't you mean *awesome
 Well, that too
 Are you using it as one big desktop or separate?
 Gave my mother a shock
 She knew I'd got a new screen and was fine with that
 But didn't reallise the full implications
 Cable arrived today, she walked iin to see 2 screens at once, finds the moving from one to another wierd!
 Ed why can't linux get viruses that do a lot of damage? Is it because no one writes them ?
 They do seem to captivate people
 Ben: nobody bothers to write them becauswe it snot worth the time
 half the stuff that a "hacker" wants to steal is native to applications only
 The security model linux adopts is partly it too, where you run processes under a user which doesn't have access to the overall system. Not the mention opensource means bugs get found and fixed much more quickly.
 so most of the applications work under windows only
 so you wouldn't get much even fi you did get into a linux machine
 probably the worst thing to get on your linux machine is a botnet, but then they're generalyl written VERY poorly
 ahh ok Ed, I was wondering earlier why Windows doesn't adopt something like that to reduce viruses.
 Robert: dual monitors is so epic
 I can't live without it now
 theres so many things I do that without 2 montiors is a pain in the ass
 ACtually Im going to convert all my projects first before i backup xD
 You'll get the bug where you just want more monitors soon Robert :P
 2 is enough for me
 would be good if you could get like a clip on monitor for laptops xD
 not really
 because laptop monitors aren't exactly substantial
 Yes really :P
 How are they not substantial ?
 they're flimsy
 not very thick
 will break easily if a large weight is placed on them
 With the technology these days Im sure they would be able to come up with a light one :P
 but then if you're going to have a secondary monitor for a laptop
 you're going to have a lot of desk space
 so why not spend less and get a pc with better specs?
 nah cos you could be on a small table :O
 :P

 Hello Robert, what's the nature of your problem?
 Please elaborate on your issue Robert
 i thought you couldn't get an ipod/iphone out of DFU for a sec then D:
 started to panic loll
 well, nto without clearing everything off
 lol
 It's a pain, but you could
 the same way you got into DFU, is the same way tog et out :P
 press & hold both home and power button for 10 secs
 until it comes on
 then release the pwoer button but continue holding home
 Dolleh you missed it, Robert and I discovered the itsy-bitsy spider button for zIRC
 Doesn't that also reset your iPod?
 onyl resets your ipod if you recover it in iTunes
 Brb
 Ah makes sense
 oeh sounds evil
 What happened to the bot?
 I'm not joking Dolleh : http://bread.uuuq.com/itsybitsyspider.png
 !seen sBot
 homg amazing!
 !seen Ben
 sbot run off
 wth is going on with cod4 D:
 IDK...lately I've been playing Halo ODST
 ew halo
 Took a break from COD
 OSDT is pretty nice...fairly similar to COD. Firefight is the best mode...kind of like Zombie mode in COD5
 sBot is waiting for events to be favourable again
 He'll be back within 48 hours is my guess
 I can't see how halo can be anything like cod
 hello
 Ed: They changed some of the game styles of Halo. It's now in one map and fairly similar to classical FPS, atleast that's how it seemed when I played it yesterday
 I still want to get the new COD
 Yeah, but do you still have ridiculous amounts of health?
 wtf is goin on today
 chrome wont resolve anything
 I really have to stop calling my friends "bastard", "slag" and "bitch"... second time it wasn't one of them and was their other half :P
 rofl EDFAIL ;D
 what could be possible causes of not being able to resolve hosts?
 nameservers ddown Pie` 
 For EVERY website I try? :D
 I doubt that :p
 Your ISP's resolver nameservers
 this is rlly annoying
 ive not been able to browse the web since about 40'clock
 4o'clock *
 Haev you tried using opendns?
 nope
 but my mother doesn't know I have access to our router :D
 so I don't want to go changing the obvious things
 You can do it on your computer
 Pie`: Linux or windows?
 windows
 Ah okay, you know about host records right?
 not really
 add one to map www.opendns.com and opendns.com to 208.69.38.150
 oh that
 yeah
 hosts file
 system32/etc/hosts I think or something the path
 Ed, no
 Then visit : https://www.opendns.com/start/device/windows-xp
 It's easier than that
 Visit that link, do what they say
 DON'T edit your hosts file
 Robert: He can't without being able to resolve opendns.com ;)
 Robert: thing is, I can't visit that link :p
 Ah, OK
 I will probably be able to if I have the ip
 hah yes
 control panel, network connections
 https://www.opendns.com/start/device/windows-xp
 it jsut started working
 O_o
 without opendns?
 yeah
 Go OpenDNS anyway...
 well, the opends site loads
 but nothing else
 my hosts file is probably fucked :p
 so after following those 6 steps
 thats it ?
 Yes
 thats sped my internet up as well :D
 That'll be Â£150 please Pie` ;)
 Dream on boyo
 Hey Ed sorry about before. Went to lunch. In ODST you no longer have rediculous amount of health. Which makes the game a lot more fun. But the game is also often very dark since there are game plays during night time
 what is required to set up an e-commerce shop ?
 because I may be getting paid £50 to do it, but I've no idea what to do :D
 hmm
 bye everyone
 Pie`, I'd say more than that
 but you're not a 16y/o with no income? ;)
 Hi there!
 I did see $50, so that makes it better
 Still, it's only going to be minimum wage...
 Hello
 I was just wondering if I could upload any media into my website
 looks like it doesn't work
 What errors are you getting?
 can't connect to ftp, general error
 only when uploading media
 such mp3 or my videos
 We don't allow music or videos
 oook
 and youtube videos?
 As they have huge potential for use by warez people
 they doesn't work as well as normal videos
 Yes, I know
 I'm using iWeb
 the youtube widget doesn't work at all
 but if I embed the object code from YT it does.
 How does the widget work?
 I don't know, it probably embeds a code into the site, but whan I look it from the browser it doesn't show up
 the YT object does
 Have to go
 Bye
 Aw no... Not you outlet :p

 !seen Ed
 Ed was last seen here 12 hours, 32 minutes ago.
 Hmm :P Afternoon all.
 afternoon Craig
 hm, its probably a bad thing that my debit card came today and it said i should already have my pin, right ?
 I thought you got you're PIN _after_
 the letter says i should have it already :P
 "You should have recieved you PIN by now. If you haven't or you have any questions, call us freem from your O2 mobile on 10202
 "
 ew, poorly encoded mp3's :{
 182kbps vbr
 No need to worry just yet, Pie`, but if it doesn't arrive in a few days time to enquire
 At least since you've got the card if someone else has the PIN it's fairly useless to them
 + I need to activate the card yet
 so even if they had the card AND the pin, they would need to know my email & password
 What's the new card for, Pie`?  O2 is an interesting card provider
 o2 cash manager card
 (Bascally its a visa debit card klinked to your mobile)
 linked *
 Right, and is this a good thing?  I care more about a range of finance services ;)
 Like, my savings account has a nice easy system for putting money into bonds for accruing interest
 And my main account is obviously my student account, with the penalty-free overdraft facility
 I don't have my own bank account, my only account is a "young savers" account which was started when I was 3, for later funds
 like driving lessons, college funds etc.
 Really?  You could've gotten one
 I think Halifax will gives you a visa electron from 13, then a visa debit later
 Having it linked to my phone though has its benefits
 its not linked cash-wise, it just sends me updates of how much cash I've got etc.
 I suppose, I consider my bank balance a bit private to have on my phone which is sometimes used by other folk
 If I get a text and I'm busy doing something and a friend is around, I like to be able to say "tell me what that says" and get them to check for me :p
 heh, nobody reads my phone but me, I have some really 'private' things on there ;)
 what the hell si this
 java's Math.sin(int) doesn't do the same thing my scientific calulator does
 aha!
 that's becuse java isn't on degrees mode

 It's not like we've got any positive history, and it's been a long time
 hey m4lt
 I thinks he's ignoring you Alex
 nothing
 just seeing what's up and checking out templates on site
 got a older PC going
 To be honest, I was happiest when he ignored the ircd altogether :p
 My job is always easier that way ;)
 I stoped that old crap
 I talked to jack here back
 he had no problem towards me
 I guess I bear grudges then, not that I'm going to make a big deal of it.  I'm probably going to stick to silence largely
 hey look at it this way at least it takes people like that to fix bugs and more security, I aint like that no more
 I don't really agree with that assessment, but if you've matured that's very good news
 m4lt, what did you used to do?
 Ah, the wonders of mibbit...

 zymic forums down ?
 Do you not receive the error message Lawny?
 i cant access zymic or the forums
 Lawny: We know
 We're just wondering why you don't know that we know
 There's an error page we put up telling you why
 You should be able to see it
 "IPS Driver Error
 There appears to be an error with the database.
 You can try to refresh the page by clicking here"
 it says ips drive error
 Thats the current page
 Ah
 The error page isn't meant to be that
 However, it is meant to be down
 ok
 The main site (not the subdomains) is being moved to a new server
 We've just gone into read-only to finalise things
 Robert I would suggest posting a notice on the main site aswell
 TheOracle: A bit late now?
 Its currently this ~> http://grab.by/66v
 The error message was quite good
 Someone do 'nslookup zymic.com' please
 sure
 Non-authoritative answer:
 Name:	zymic.com
 Address: 216.18.194.242
 That one
 OK, now for the new explanation
 Yep, new server, that was quick...
 The old server DOES have the error message up
 Can those of you do /dns zymic.com
 But apparently our (but not E*d's :p) ISP has already refreshed the dns
 So we're being redirected to the NEW server
 Which doesn't have the error messages yet, and is also not yet allowed to edit the forum details as the data needs to be moved over
 Try now please
 Sorry, one moment.
 k
 Now should be good
 Nope
 TheOracle /dns zymic.com 
 Nope
 please
 .. /forum redirected to server-maintenance
 but now its the same message as the root
 (17:47:20)- Permission Denied- You do not have the correct IRC operator privileges @@ Jack ?
 ok
 same message as the root TheOracle?
 "An Error Occured While Connecting To (CONNECT)
 Server: 'localhost'
 MySQL Said: Access denied for user 'zv6_v6'@'localhost' (using password: YES) (Err No. )"
 zymic is back up for me...
 The root at least
 Says that on the root and /forum
 TheOracle: You get that error on http://www.zymic.com ?
 Yea
 w/ or w/o www.
 still the same message
 JUST "http://www.zymic.com" no filename?
 Yep, still the error
 That definitely shouldn't be happening.
 Nothing appears to deter it
 Not trying to login or anything TheOracle?
 Nope
 Should I clear my cookies maybe?
 I'm pretty sure the old site stored my login
 Oh the MySQL error
 Yeah, that's because db isn't across.
 DNS wasn't meant to propagate THAT fast.
 Alright, I'll wipe the cookies then
 So you're looking at the new server
 Yes
 Hmm
 Clearing cookies didn't work ...
 I have an error too
 Getting redirect loop now
 nope gone now
 MySQL err is back
 http://grab.by/66I
 that is the image of it
 O_O_O
 Oooh I got a nother error
 "Query has caused an errorWarning: An error occured while calling DB::select_db()"
 lol
 That's debug mode off, it's a little less revealing than what was there before.
 Be right back

 Hello again robotdude101 
 Well im setting up my SMF forum right now!

 I think something went wrong with hubbard
 even more quit in #mediawiki ...
 My forum just got installed
 im really good at making php cms systems now!
 i love it though
 right now im making a cms which can edit all of its pages and components within the site itself
 ... Thats the entire purpose of a CMS in the first place ...
 not using FTP to edit articles ...
 yes, but my cms can edit the header, nav, and footer also
 Case in point.
 huh
 ?
 TheOracle: WP is a CMS. You can't edit a lot of how it looks from within the site
 You need to upload the template files by FTP
 Different CMS's do different things
 They're for managing content generally
 visuals is only 1 type of content
 Hi Jack
 i was right
 my cms is the best
 but i need advice on pagination
 should i use jquery or php for it?
 JQuery or PHP...?
 The only way you could eliminate PHP from pagination is to provide every single result on load and then process the range to display via JS
 And that would be a horrible idea
 So do you really mean should you use something AJAX
 And what about users without javascript?
 hmm
 php it is :D lol
 You would certainly want to implement a purely PHP version
 yeah, i know what you mean
 But on load you could replace page load links with an AJAX link via javascript that would make a HTTP request for a different page of results
 PHP_Guru = CSS_Guru ?
 yes
 That would work, and because the AJAX interface is only loaded via Javascript it degrades elegantly
 im going to do php pagination guys thanks
 Both suggestions I gave were PHP powered
 I think perhaps you misunderstand that using jQuery or similar doesn't get rid of the PHP
 i wonder if php will ever be as powerful as asp...
 Why isn't it "as powerful as ASP"?
 Eww, ASP...
 i've heard from people working at microsoft , that asp is wayy more powerful than php
 If you're talking about ASP.NET including the .NET framework then you would have to compare it to PHP plus one of the PHP frameworks available
 Haha... I'm sure they're not biased at all, PHP_Guru
 Exactly :p
 Wait, damn, I mean "Tommy"
 yes?
 I was typing too quickly to register that I refuse to call novices a guru ;)
 So did they provide any actual evidence for ASP being more powerful?
 novices isn't a word...
 Or are we going to go on vague claims from un-named people with an obvious conflict of interest.
 Bah...
 It's the plural of novice, Tommy
 I haven't even hit the road yet, but I already feel sick...
 LOL owned!
 the plural of novice is novi.
 Er, no?
 yes it is
 No it isn't
 look it up please
 Evidence or it ain't true.
 http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/novice
 > novice (plural novices)
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novice
 look under the picture
 Ownt
 In the caption
 that would be incorrect Im sorry.
 Buddhist novices in Wangdue Phodrang Dzong, Bhutan
 the plural of novice is and always will be novi.
 PHP_Guru you think you know a lot dont you ?
 Merriam-Webster says it isn't "Novi" :|
 It actually comes up "novices"
 http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/novices
 it was changed to the plural of novi yesterday, corresponding to 3:34PM
 And I don't think Merriam-Webster would lie :|
 I think you'll find novices is the colloquial and is perfectly acceptable
 yes, but it is clearly wrong
 How?
 Even if it was originally "novi", languages change
 What's slang becomes colloquially accepted, becomes standard.
 exactly
 Novices is pretty much standard
 uh huh ok :D
 gtg bye
 He left when he knew he was wrong.
 What a nob.
 I still can't find anything saying it even was "novi"
 It doesn't fit with latin pluralisation
 Anyways, it was petty
 UrbanDictionary actually says its derived from novices to describe someone with no skill
 But I guess he had to try a comeback to me calling him a novice, when it's plainly true :p
 Probably.
 Why is it I always get so fucking sick when reading in the car? Fucking retarded.
 Bah, I get it to some degree on long journeys without doing any reading :p
 Thats being /carsick/ mate :p
 I know, but it's the same thing, reading makes it worse
 Ah.
 So you probably have it to a small degree
 Doesn't get bad until you try reading
 Well, I get it within 5 minutes of reading anything in the car whilst it is in motion.
 The thing with carsickness, looking out the window at fast moving objects = bad
 Looking in the distance = good
 Reading = awful ;)
 Yea, but its going to be 2 hours...
 Mp3 player?
 Have a doze in the back :p
 And its so hard to fall asleep in the car, let alone any car
 For me
 I don't get to sleep, but sit back and listen to music
 I'd get bored after a while.
 I'll probably watch a DVD if I get sick again.
 Ah, not really a music person? ;)
 I don't see that's likely to be better than reading
 I don't get sick when watching videos in the car :|
 That's odd
 Indeed.
 Anyone read the book "Jane Eyre" ?
 I'll be off then, bye everyone
 Probably won't be back til tomorrow or monday

 ugh
 darn thing won't reply to pings
 Thanks Ben :P
 hm
 i wonder why it outputs everyhting twice
 :s
 Pie`: Does there have to be a space inside the area where you put the server?
 what
 Nvm
 Anyone here good with PHP
 Creme is
 and Dolleh
 There a couple T_T
 :O
 BEN i'm awfully dissapointed in YOU
 You die like he does D:
 THE BEN IS MEAN TO MEEEE
 Ben you are?
 ben, no more musics for you!
 DOlleh Im sorry didn't really mean that, but you were angry at me D:
 Sorry Perry not, try #php
 first you call me a darkkrai, then a creme, thats TOO MUCH for one evening...
 Ben: :O I aint that good, I only know how to echo and make sessions and terminate sessiona and etc.:O
 :O
 hurr durr troll
 :o
 :o
 ^
 wow
 theres no substring function in ruby
 O_o
 really :O
 Whats the laptop in the dell advert called?
 xps9000? :P
 Ben: ye rly
 jk
 Nah its like £400 I think,
 Wow Pie` thats weird, loads of langs have that.
 I know
 and I can't find a split function
 that isn't a private member
 Ruby is making me angry :@
 if(buf.include? "PING"):
 should return true when a ping event happens
 but it doesn't O_o
 hmm
 Good laptop Brandon http://www1.euro.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/laptop-inspiron-1545?c=uk&l=en&s=dhs&cs=ukdhs1 ?
 May have just worked out why though Ben :p
 Silly me not reading docs properly
 oh ?
  hehe
 I was using Socket.recvfrom(len) to read from socket
 thought it returned what i read
 this ruby ?
 but it actually returns an array, the first element is what it read, the second element is protocol specific info
 and yeah
 buf = sock.recvfrom(200)[0]
 that should work :D
 if it doesn't I'm gonna flip...
 :)
 DOlleh
 Dolleh*
 WHA? D:
 ARE YOU STALKING ME BEN?

 last.fm I have like 10.5k plays
 They so do..
 so I just let it play what I like

 + last.fm is bigger
 Brandon: When I tried spotify, I searched 3 or 4 bands, they had max about 2 songs from each
 :P
 Agreed, Ed. :p
 So, Brandon... can I please have some space on your server?
 give him 100KB Brandon 
 Ed you eveil man :O

 Brandon what CD do I need to reformat?
 All your rap music ones Ben ;)
 Use the CD for something on the verge of being useful.
 haha thats all backed up on my iPod ;)
 Better get formatting that too then :P
 It's very useful Ed, especially in the CD player ;)
 haha that would be rather silly now wouldn't it, Id lose my music :(
 Some could argue it's music
 Would be very hard ;)
 Dolleh likes it :)
 She lives in the ghetto ;)
 So do I ;)
 surrre
 i used to live in the ghetto
 then i got evicted....
 That's low :P
 Where is Brandon when you need him :(
 yea :(
 What's after the ghetto, shanty? 
 lol
 nah i actually upgraded a bit
 I wouldn't know, that situation has never occured, Ben
 moved in with a lady friend, on the outskirts of a bigger town
 haha xD
 I just want to reformat so i can partition my hdd to run kubuntu, vista and windows 7
 Start with the two windows install CDs, build the partition tables in those and install them
 Then install Linux last onto the remaining partition
 You want to do it in that order, otherwise you'd have to chroot into Linux afterwards to replace Windows' shitty bootloader
 ahh ok cheers
 Well, remaining two+ partitions dending on how you structure the Linux installation
 And if you include a swap partition
 I was thinking of just reformatting, then setting up the two other partitions (W7 and linux) after.
 You can partition from the Windows installer if you've got a proper install CD
 I need to install linux properly this time though, last time it fked my hdd :(
 Nope I don't have the cd, i have 3 recovery cds which i had to make.
 is newegg the best place to buy parts to build a new pc?
 They don't deliver to the UK so I've never tried them
 yea im in the usa
 wanting a new pc
 I guessed
 but im not that familiar with that kind of stuff
 But I was pointing out the people here right now can't comment on newegg ;)
 ahh gotcha lol
 well...
 Ben, fair enough then, that is probably how you'll have to do it, I wouldn't resize twice though
 can anyone here simply put together a decent setup for around $300 using newegg and give me the link?
 Ben, I'd probably install, resize the windows installation down to the size I want it at the end, and then add the partitions for the next two installs then
 ive used newegg before... just wasnt sure if you guys knew of a better place
 Resizing is more error-prone than anything else, so the less times you do that the better
 JaXm: I suppose I could, but it wouldn't be terribly helpful.  You should know your own hardware
 lol im not too computer savvy like that... i come on, do my stuff and thats it, i dont dig around to learn everything i can
 That way if you want to make changes later you're not going to have to ask me if it'll work ;)
 Basic stuff like building a system from compatible hardware is not difficult
 lol i know the basics... like what each piece is used for
 ahh ok, well when i work out how to reformat then if i can partition then then ill make 3 partitions :)
 First of all (at least this is the way I do it)
 Decide what kind of CPU you'd like
 Intel tends to do better for power per $ at the moment
 yea i usually go with intel... last one i had was amd though
 idk... i just dont know like all the differences between stuff
 Right lets give this a go, i may be back soon if it doesn't work lol D:
 like agp vs pci video card... ddr vs drr2..
 When you've got a reasonably priced CPU
 Then you look at the socket it uses
 Then you pick a motherboard with a matching socket
 ok
 AGP is pretty much dead as far as GPU interfaces go
 Get PCI-E
 ok
 So you need a PCI-E (16x) slot on the motherboard
 As far as RAM goes, you're just getting the fastest you can afford
 That will depend on the motherboard you find
 ok
 Heh, said "ok" too much
 SATA for the hard drive and ideally the DVD drive and whatever else you get in there
 Because SATA cables are faster, and /so/ much nicer to work with than IDE ribbons :p
 lol yea... my bad
 yea i got a sata in my current one... alot easier lol
 Make sure you buy a "Retail" pack for the CPU
 That will include a heatsink and fan
 ah
 ok
 A few case fans won't go awry
 Motherboards typically have gigabit ethernet ports as standard
 If you want wifi that's probably not standard at your price range
 But for a desktop I advocate ethernet over wifi anyway
 For a cheapish build like this if you've got a 400W power supply that will probably do nicely
 500W would be certain
 You can get case/power-suppy combinations
 yup
 That makes things a bit easier
 think my current one is a 400
 last one died on me so i got a new one... not sure though
 I'm personally an nvidia person for graphics cards
 Among other things for a cursory comparison of cards the interfaces it provides is a decent measure
 no preference here... ive used both equally with no opinions
 I've bought three 7600GTs for various machines over time because they were well priced, decent power and gave me dual DVI outputs
 I've got two in one desktop, and one in another :p
 nice nice
 hmm... i dont want a micro atx board do i?
 I wouldn't say so
 lookin at cpu + mobo combo
 Ah, fair enough does it have the heatsink and cpu fan included in that as well?
 Though seating a CPU is fairly easy :p
 dont think it does :/
 yea i know how to like put them together and all that
 That would be annoying then, you do need those
 just the actual hardware and what not im not sure of
 If you don't want the CPU to burn out, or throttle itself down to stop it overheating
 lol
 hows this?
 http://www.newegg.com/Product/ComboDealDetails.aspx?ItemList=Combo.235123
 The retail box should already have one
 Dunno why you'd spend $31 replacing it on a low-spec box :p
 ohhh
 i see it now
 oops
 Failed :(
 just saw this one... any good?
 http://www.newegg.com/Product/ComboDealDetails.aspx?ItemList=Combo.259608
 wait
 its a micro atx board :S
 micro comps suck bawls
 Pie` know anything about reformatting windows ?
 it's easy to do
 I just put in my recovery disks yah ?
 just stick in the disk of the thing you wanna replace it with
 I read on a site I had to do that.
 and install to the partition
 make sure you dont make a new partition
 but write over everything already there
 yup, thats how you do it
 I like Acer's e-recovery
 hmmm so say I wanted to reformat to vista (Which I have now) then i...
 Is it an Acer PC Ben?
 Compaq
 Looking to buy a Dell when my EMA starts :)
 Dell's reformat is awesome
 I really should od at some point some
 soon*
 do it*
 IBM has  a browser built in to their recovery disk!
 FML why dont i get an awesome one :(
 How does the Dell one work Robert?
 At the right point in the boot up you press the right combination of keys
 Few button presses
 10 minutes later, your computer has just come out of the box it was sent in
 Windows, all programs (down to the trial version of Norton)
 Aha, sounds like e-recovery, what's nice about Acer's is they're setup with a "data" drive which doesn't get wiped in the format, so can just stick bits on there 
 Yep, it does take 5GB from your HDD
 But it's worth it for the convienience
 Yeah definitely. Nice to know you don't need the boot discs too
 You just made me time out an ssh log in...
 Hah
 honestly, distracting me like that
 Who do you think you are?
 :p
 Robert whats this :O http://grab.by/6oR
 That looks like it
 http://grab.by/6oS yes or no?
 I'd try that, except you're trying to re-partition, right?
 Sorry im a noob :(
 What exactly is the problem you're trying to solve here?
 Ill re-partition later, for now i just want to reformat and have a clean install of vista
 I think i has lots of viruses and shit on my comp :(
 Have you backed everything up?
 Yep
 Then what is there to lose? :p
 YES
 Ok cheers, urm my laptop if I do it wrong xD
 Nah, you'll just need to reformat the hard way if that happens
 This is the last page, could be the oen http://grab.by/6oT
 Whats the hard way ?
 Yes to that
 go through BIOS/dos/another computer to reformat
 hmmm I think ill try restoring to factory condition like in that screenshot
 if doesn't work then will have to do hard way
 I read that i had to insert my recovery Cd then restard but that just came up with this http://grab.by/6oP (http://pastesite.com/10686)
 right lets try this, brb!
 sup
 We've just ruined Ben's computer, if you must know
 yes...
 Did he take backups? :P
 yes
 Ed, have you ever set up a cron job on dreamhost?
 hey! who said that!
 I certainly have, some time ago
 It's not difficult :p
 Yeah Adam, through ssh at least
 There's something in the panel for it as well
 It uses pretty much the same format
 I'm setting one up now, it just asks for Command to Run
 so I put, php domain.com/folder/script.php
 an it emailed me, sh: php: command not found
 so it just be sh by default?
 try /usr/bin/php or /bin/php, if you pop into ssh do ,'whereis php'
 does the php mail() function work on zymic free host?
 I believe you have to pay for it
 are there any other hosts that have it?
 for free
 Google free webhosts
 there are thousands

 Anyone know what mAh means when it comes to batteries?
 7200mAh, 4400mAh
 milli amps
 ^
 per hour?
 So how long will 7200 last?
 depends on the draw
 are you referring to laptop batteries jack?
 Yes
 with that much amps i would think so
 Yeah i was hoping :P
 most standard batteries don't have that many amps
 His flashlight could be supercharged though :P
 Jack with moderate use I would say around 6 hours
 Ok ta
 milliAmpHours Jack
 milliAmpHours/milliAmps drawn = hours of life
 http://www.ukbattery.net/laptop/nesnz19.html?gclid=CNjJqLnrlJ0CFYIA4wodgUhp0w
 6600mAh is bigger and sticks out at back
 do not want :(
 But it will last 50% longer
 What's the draw of the laptop?
 It probably doesn't say
 Shouldn't of started ;)
 Well no it doesn't but 4400mAh is the right size
 You see I'm selling this laptop
 But can't until it has a new battery, this one doesn't last
 some times it better to have it stick out a little, props the laptop up like those keybaord stand things on the bottom of a normal keyboard and also lets air vent better
 10 seconds

 fuckin internet
 will somekick Perry i had to restart my internet and now its stuck :P
 nvm
 For future reference, a kick won't help
 The nick is still taken until the ping timeout, or if it's killed
 Ooh, thank you.
 Of course, if you've registered the nick
 register, then ghost yourself
 You can kill it yourself via ghost
 ...
 He's back
 How did it go?
 Darn it Robert, jumping in the middle using less words to beat me ;)
 I'd already typed it once
 how do I register a nick?
 But, with multiple screens, it appeared in the middle of some xml...
 Type /ns help
 Then follow the help through
 Thank you
 It went all good thanks Robert :D
 Aw well, we all hoped
 But apparently our prayers went unanswered

 'The final quote from the music industry, striking out at UK ISPs, is priceless: "BT is clinging on to an old business model which is supported by illegal downloading. That's not only unfair to artists and creators, but penalizes BT's many customers who use the Internet legally."'

 Fine, thanks. Just trying to get screen started in SSH
 I don't think its present
 hey perry
 and theoracle
 hey Rico
 theOracle, can you please test out my email service?
 No

 lol recaptcha takes a lot of work to get working
 im going to add an email format checker
 So how do i create new page for fowarding links
 bbl
 You mean we have to have you back TheOracle?
 yeah outlet, it does
 i dont know how to get keys for subdomains such as .vndv.com
 outlet, do you know how to get keys for subdomain hosting?
 nope
 go to a key-smith
 hmm I hope I installed Kubuntu correctly
 http://grab.by/6ty :D

 how do i create page to set up accounts
 You will need a PHP user system
 I believe there is one in the Tutorial section on the forums or http://www.olate.co.uk/articles/185
 thank you
 back
 Ed you there?
 I am
 I'm trying to run screen in bash, but it says it can't find that command
 Is there some sort of psuedo-name for it in bash?
 nn
 Go on! Be off with you Ben
 nn Ben
 Not that I've come across TheOracle you will probably need to install it
 Can you give me the command that I do? I have the tarball but frickin NotePad or Vim will read INSTALL correctly
 Nevermind
 Vim has opened it now
 can i see someones site
 anyone here seen the film Surrogates?
 That hasn't been released yet ...
 Yeah it has
 i just got back form watching it
 If i reserve my domain name for a year do still have to use Clanteam.com
 what?
 Sorry TheOracle wasn't paying attention
 IS BACK

 Ed
 I'm trying to find the PID when tPyD runs
 Yo
 $!
 but its not listing it, only bash and ps
 `length :Pie`!Eden@Zymic-5D94B058.demon.co.uk PRIVMSG #test :
 Length: 53
 Not sure what you mean TheOracle?
 $! is a bash variable that contains a pid of the last process ran if that's what you mean
 Ah
 In a bash script I should say
 so if you were to do something like
 /path/to/script &
 echo $! > /var/run/myscript.pid
 you'd have the pid stored so you could then just do kill $(cat /var/run/myscript.pid)
 just doing echo $! isn't showing the PID
 I suppose its because when I want to get back to the command line I do ^D since ^C will kill the bot
 I /think/
 it did that when it wasn't in the background
 sec
 Ed is suggesting putting this into a script, and using & to put it in the background, not working from the prompt
 Yes but I'd like to test the concept out first
 You can bring back the process
 jobs
 Ah
 Its working now
 probable [1] yourscript
 fg %1
 Found them in ps
 Welcome back to foreground :P
 yea...
 didn't realize that it removed them from the jobs list when I left SSH
 Its there now
 http://grab.by/6ue
 Yeah you need to either nohup them to leave them running or run them in a screen session
 There's two processes because its required to fork the IRC process as a thread from the reloading process
 Everything appears to be in proper working order now
 I'll start on the system you mentioned though
 Where is fuckface Ben >.<
 He went to bed Brandon
 Lovely, he has annoyed me. Sending me a text saying "Mert how reformat" like he hasn't done it before.. ffs.

 Oh... it seems this is wrong Rico. Lulz.
 As you were.

 RICO, the best way to learn stuff is not to follow tutorials imo
 but set yourself a goal
 and just write from what you know
 if you get an error, look up what the error means
 and possible causes for the error
 i know very little of php
 Woohoo
 Got a loop to get the PIDs for pyDelphi

 lets try this
 i have a template issue
 can someone gelp me with that ?
 type /msg nickserv register password email
 i type the passworrd and email
 chech your email
 check*
 lol
 extension_dir does not exists /usr/lib/php4/20020429/    keeps coming up when i upload my template
 any advice?
 that is php4...
 Zymic no longer supports php4
 it is bad for your health
 lol
 why is it bad for u?
 find a template or w/e that runs php5 5.3.0 is what zymic is on
 where can i find one thats a youtube clone?
 and is free?
 don't know
 a youtube clone template? o.0
 yes
 i made one, but it requires an .exe file for video processing, and you cannot upload an .exe file to zymic
 If we find a youtube clone we'll shut it down
 owned
 duh
 www.phpmotion.com
 have u seen their templates?
 whos owned?
 brb
 Don't leave us Ben!
 that clone also uses ffmpeg
 ok?
 its like the de facto standard for audio/video processing and codec
 ok?
 banned?
 can upload it?
 it is an .exe, you cannot have thoses anyway
 so that template doesnt work on your server?
 nope
 and even if it did, it wouldn't be allowd to stay up
 omg!
 why ?
 ToS
 ???
 TOs?
 Terms of Service 
 i know 
 but how does it violate it
 http://www.zymic.com/free-web-hosting/tos/
 ok
 i missed something
 Rockrbns What exactly does this script do?
 How does it work?
 I'm not sure where it says it in there, but it is there in all that legal mumbo-jumbo.
 allow other users to upload vidoes....
 That won't work, as we don't allow video extension filenames
 A video is upload, ffmpeg.exe (running in background) takes the video frame by frame to transcode it into usually .FLV to play with flash.
 oooh
 well
 thanks
 Interfere with or disrupt the System or servers or networks connected to the System, or disobey any requirements, procedures, policies or regulations of networks connected to the System;
 It also goes under that
 As these are heavy server usage scripts, and they disrupt the service for other users
 recomend another hoster?
 freewebs?
 idk
 no free host usually lets you do that stuff
 transcoding the video files eats up CPU
 yes
 i am see i am gonna have to stop being cheap
 *sigh*
 good idea ;)
 for a free hosting you guys got a bit of everything

 you guys work there or just hanging out?

 Wifi on Kubuntu is a pain in the ass
 Every time I update the OS, it removes all hardware info for wifi. So then I have to go through the headache of backend install work
 i could use a webmaster that wants to do some free work
 lol
 Rockrbns: It may be hard to find
 Considering most of the designers here on IRC charge around $30-60 an hour
 i have a programer i have known since i was a child to do it

 Bots are ok
 Unless RobertK decided to call himself "CSharpBot"

 maby he did
 Or maby i'm making an irc client ;/
 We prefer not to have unsanctioned bots in official channels
 Sorry, i'll take him else wear to debug
 And certainly if they're generating a lot of noise, I would prefer the testing happened in another channel
 Your glad he isn't compiled right now or he would cry...
 Your talking about him like that
 *You are
 If you get it to stop the join/quit spam, and there's a legitimate use for the bot not already covered by existing services, he can come back
 But understandably, it's not really worth it being here before that
 Here being #zymic, I have no problem with testing on the network
 Provided all the functionality is legal, not doubting that it is - but I'm one of these people who has to clarify everything ;)

 hey all
 TheOracle: 08:46 PM UTC <outlet> tell TheOracle that you keep repeating stuff
 Aye yes
 Not sure what's causing that yet
 %fq
 TheOracle: Forcequit by entering the following command in SSH: kill 15987 | kill 15988
 TheOracle We were wondering why you're piping the result of one kill into another kill?
 Its two commands on one line ...
 Thats the purpose of the pipe
 Or atleast thats what it does in this terminal
 No
 You're giving the output of `kill 15987` as the input to `kill 15988`
 It works, both get executed
 Oh
 I imagine `kill 15987 15988` is probably the normal way
 But I'm not sure
 hi TO
 using a  ;  gives you 2 commands on one line.
 Well Robert... I can fix that after I construct the continuous process manager
 Ok
 Do you know if there's any way to run a process under a name?
 Because I don't think just judging how many "PYTHON" processes are running will cut it...
 i'm no wizard but you could use screen while spawning them
 and name each screen
 Yea, but I don't have screen
 I would need Brandon to install it
 and he's not here
 Wait, I may be able to install it in my own directory
 yep
 you should be
 and i can't think of much of an alternative but...
 if it doesnt work out, maybe you can use a naming convention with names pipes
 and categorize your processes by using them
 that's if you can use named pipes, of course
 I'm out for today. C'ya guys

 Alright I think I have it installed
 not sure what to run now though

 b) I'm not allowed to do it there
 Ah, yeah, halfops don't get that chanserv access

 waht is it?

 you there?
 You're already getting impatient about a response?  Less than a minute after you finished asking it?
 Judging from that PM, you are

 It's considered pretty rude to PM people you don't know without asking first

 So, here's your answer for now:
 This isn't the hosting support channel
 You should have noticed when you went to our live chat page
 There were two options, one of them was hosting support
 You seem to have clicked the other one for reasons I cannot discern
 Anyone here an audiophile ?
 No, I'm sane ;)
 I'm sure most of the stuff audiophiles go on about is in their head :p
 haha
 well, I'm trying to find someone who has had first hand experience with a set of skullcandy headphones
 :D
 i have pie
 are they any good ?
 link to the set your looking at
 hey all
 and what are you using them for? just an ipod or something?
 hey orcy
 kdigennaro: titan earbuds in black
 and just using for an ipod?
 In which case sound quality is already out the window ;)
 iPods aren't known for that :p
 kdigennaro:  yeah
 it's true alex :D
 Alex: anything will be better than the set you get with the ipod
 they're so bad...
 This is true
 Pie` there fine but why spend that much on ipod head phones lol
 go to walgreens and pick up a set for 7 bucks
 I won't be spending anything kdigennaro ^___^
 freebies ftw
 But provided you get a "decent" pair with an alright dynamic range
 o lol
 That's about as good as you'll get with that hardware ;)
 then why does it matter if ther good or not? :P
 yup :D 
 man ive had these studio head phone monitors for like 3 years and never hooked them to an ipod lol
 i should :P
 hmm
 Not that I have enough money to compare a large range, but going from reviews they always get noted for sound quality
 And a huge range of supported file formats
 Including some I have never heard of, and wonder who uses
 Does anyone know when pyDelphi was last on?
 buy a pair of these, there on my christmas list for my studio lol, http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/S2Ad/
 Mine supports something called "Monkeys Audio"
 I'm trying a /whowas bu its showing when it logged on
 As well as mp3, wma, ogg, flac etc
 Very much like having ogg support, got a few that I couldn't be bothered to transcode, just being able to upload them was good

 do i need to lighten up my buttons on my nav? http://www.digennarodesigns.com/clients/MMS_WP/?page_id=9
 yes
 That or give them a stronger border
 and move the title to the left
 Definitely needs some contrast somewhere
 er, right*
 its off-center
 which is making my eye twitch
 yeah the title was just thrown on there by wp lol
 ill play with the button
 should i change the button or lighten the bg?
 :D
 Lightening the background would lessen the hover effect
 It worked :)
 But whatever you're happy with :p
 true :P ill play with it lol
 I'm going to change the frequency back to 15 minutes...
 %test
 pyDelphi is working.
 hmmm i lightened it but it blends with the bg now lol
 Is http://centralwebsite.com/ Brandon's, Alex?
 Because thats my host that comes up in bash
 max.centralwebsite.com more specifically
 I've no idea
 Whois is uninformative, and I don't recognise the domain
 They both have the same IP
 http://grab.by/6T7
 Of course they do, we generally work with the one Internet Protocol ;)
 It may just be a second domain of his
 that he has yet to setup
 Sorry forgot your pet peeve Alex

 I got that one from Ed :p

 It is a bit lazy to omit it though
 True
 is this better or worse? http://www.digennarodesigns.com/clients/MMS_WP/?page_id=9

 wat if i make them purple ish liek the header bars? www.sharpielovers.com/images/grabs/dHSAh.png
 Don't see why I should have to put up with other people being lazy ;)
 True
 Besides, technical correctness is something I'm always keen on, comes from being an engineer :p
 But you're going to meet a lot of lazy people, so I'd get ready for a /lot/ of typing
 kdigennaro: try it out live
 i will this gray might be the winner
 ill compare the two :P
 Engineers take laziness to an art form, we do work to provide consistent standards with the least work possible :p
 hey have a good day, I am going to read helps
 Much better than bog-standard normal laziness that just results in problems
 byebye
 We get efficiency ;)
 Ah
 Very nice
 Ergh.
 I'll tell you what, my pet peeve is when people forget a line terminator in bash for the last line
 Then I get something like this: http://grab.by/6Ti
 Heh, can be annoying yeah, but I just hit enter :p
 That happened a lot with Jailshell aswell...
 Yea
 But it accumulates unessecary clutter
 Hmm
 Well, you can always "clear" when it gets annoying
 Never can spell "unessecary"
 Takes it back to one visibile prompt line
 unnecessary
 yea
 gj Google
 I can use "clear"
 alright so this gray, http://www.digennarodesigns.com/clients/MMS_WP/?page_id=9 vs purple, ill upload after u see the gray
 But that would defeat the purpose of the command, if I need to read it
 Pfft, as if I need google for that word :p
 :O!
 k kdigennaro
 ready for the purple? :P
 yeh
 I find your lack of faith disturbing
 kk refresh
 Moving on to Star Wars quotes now are we Alex? ;)
 Alex - where is that quote from?
 kdigennaro: I like the gray
 Only when they fit
 Star Wars, Rob
 kk
 thanks :d
 time to code the rest..
 TheOracle I thought so, thanks
 p.s e107 fails
 Ur-durh
 lol
 I told you it'd let you down kdigennaro
 But, no!
 You wouldn't take my word.
 lol i wanted to be a rebel :P and try something different :P
 well you failed.
 tbh i got it to do wat i wanted just wanted happy with the admin panel
 wasnt*
 I told you that it'd /let you down/, not "not work"
 wp has a much nicer admin section
 haha true
 so far wordpress has been easier to code aswell.. lol
 They're going to make it work somehow if they're going to release it
 Unless you're a Cr`eme...
 How bad is e107 to theme then?  I found wp fairly annoying, not difficult, but just irritating :p
 %seen Ben
 Sorry, I haven't seen ben around.
 :@
 !seen Ben
 Ben was last seen here 1 hour, 38 minutes ago.
 Damn
 e107 is a huge pain.. lol you have to create "shortcodes" for just about anything you want to do custom
 Not being able to have it as HTML 4.01 Strict was the first thing ;)
 then if you put them in the wrong place they all get wiped out on an update lol
 But mostly I find it's very inflexible in how you get the eventual markup
 Oh, kdigennaro...
 I find I can't make the source look good
 No matter how hard I try :p
 Can you do a quick design for me when you're free?
 Yeah that always bugs me :D
 wat you need orcy?
 A better looking doc...
 http://to.threedicedrop.com/
 Something simple because its only one page though
 Just get back to me when you have time :)
 kk
 Yikes
 orcy why not just use a free template?
 I really don't expect no indentation at all from a python coder
 honestly its one page :P with no nav just steal a template lol
 hey atleast its valid alex ;) www.sharpielovers.com/images/grabs/33zZt.png
 Alex: I was going to indent, but I was in a rush
 I had to put that up quickly so I could get back to moving pydelphi
 Actually... I followed the link, kdigennaro :p
 lol
 Result:  	 4 Errors, 1 warning(s) 
 haha!!
 lmao
 o_O
 lol
 I didn't know that link was there, haha
 You missed a ! TheOracle
 you haev an <h2></h1>
 <!DOCTYPE, not <DOCTYPE
 http://grab.by/6To
 those will fix all four errors ;)
 lol some kid created this as there band logo.... www.sharpielovers.com/images/grabs/33zZt.png
 In any case, don't necessarily need design work here, just a plainish CSS stylesheet
 www.sharpielovers.com/images/grabs/1icY7.png <-- oops
 I have a few I use for that kind of thing
 weird
 it says I've capitalized TYPE
 But I haven't...
 http://grab.by/6Tp
 http://www.alex-elliott.co.uk/rules/ for example, though I don't think I included a definition list style in there
 Or this one: http://alex-elliott.co.uk/test/
 andrew sent me an email, his computer died lol
 well its valid now
 Anyways, you're welcome to poach either of those an edit them to your purposes
 But documentation is easy to style :p
 It doesn't really need design flair ;)
 ty
 already looks better :) http://to.threedicedrop.com/
 I'm going to replace the <dl> with a table however
 ew tables :(
 Its for data mate
 Therefore its fine :)
 ah okay :D
 all good then :D
 people go crazy with tables... they think just because they eat on them they should start building them everywhere...
 how do you guys style your html comments?
 css comments **
 here's mine, www.sharpielovers.com/images/grabs/pBNQY.png
 These days, I tend to go for a Java documentation kind of style
 Hello Ladies.
 If It's complicated enough to merit them
 The truth is that typically I don't bother to comment it ;)
 I see :d
 I consider the stylesheet self-explanatory
 yeah I usually comment sections so i can easily find divs etc to edit, for instance "header style starts" or something
 hello.
 Hello Telluris 
 I've written enough that I know how I format them :p
 hello.
 Were I handing it over to someone else I might deign to comment it, but I know the structure of my CSS documents
 i see :p
 yeah that's a good point
 YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I HATE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 ?
 aww so much hate
 What did I do...?
 he's jealous
 cause your THE oracle DUH
 You mean you don't remember me?
 No
 Well then....
 Good...
 Uh-huh.
 Ok.
 Can I go now?
 no.
 Too bad.
 You mean you don't recognize my ip?
 COME ON... YOU'VE SEEN BEFORE ON WIKIMETRU!
 ?
 Aka Gelu?
 what?
 Telluris: Why the capital letters?
 yes, on bionicle.referata.com /
 it's supposed to be that way.

 idiot.
 To be fair to Ed, Brandon
 I suggested it ;)
 You did?
 But I think he probably would have anyway
 'twas pretty obvious abuse
 In that case... ;)
 AAHHH!!!!!! HELP!!!!!!!!
 what's the temptation?
 I dunno
 But if he doesn't start contributing something to the conversation I think a mute might be prudent ;)
 lol...
 You do indeed mr power abuser 3 times now >.<
 ok.... what's the conversation?
 I believe you have trumped me on all of those pseudo-occasions
 The one this morning was possibly, but you were gloating
 :P
 3?
 I dunno, there's always political commentary
 I can get to 2
 For example, I have recently added a certain Tim Kelsey to my "idiot list"
 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8283240.stm
 BBC NEWS | UK | UK Politics | Surveillance state 'a good thing'
 Yea, 2 but I wanted to make it sound more convincing :p
 Alex - I'll admit there are limits to how far it should go but, to a large extent, if you're doing nothing wrong, why not?
 "Let's take the utmost care about privacy" also "lets collect more personal data"
 Huge DNA db? I'd probably vote yes, assuming security can be sorted
 When it's been proven time and time again that these sort of databases are misused, pose a significant security risk and don't help
 But I do know that's a big assume
 Robert: despite the fact there's no correlation between our enormous DNA database and solved crimes?
 It's almost as large as the EU one by itself
 You'd think it would have made a difference by now
 Someone I know is working on old unsolved rape crimes
 The few he's managed to solve have all been done by new advances in DNA, and fluke
 Anecdotal evidence
 Give me statistics
 E.g, someone is pulled over for drink driving ect, and shown to be a familly match for the criminal, so they test
 I would agree it's anecdotal
 But the whole problem with it is
 I would also agree there are huge risks of misuse and security
 People who've had cases dropped, or they've been exhonerated
 It's still in the database
 hello.
 But in principle I support it
 Why should innocent people's biometric data be put at risk?
 When it has no statistical impact on crime
 It's immoral.
 And the EU court of human rights agrees that it's antithetical to any democratic nation
 It gives police the ability to frame of a crime that haven't committed yourself.
 to frame you of a *
 Brandon - how?
 If they have peoples DNA...
 What else do I need to say? :p

 >_>
 V_V
 ^_^
 moreeee?
 <_>
 HAH
 brb
 I just click "format" on one of my drives http://grab.by/72m to wipe linux but it's still on there :S
 Click delete
 It says the sapce is free though :S http://grab.by/72s
 WHAT
 TPB IS DOWN?
 TPB?
 Turner Public Broadcasting
 ?
 no
 cant say
 'illegal' stuffs
 Turning People Black?
 Oh 
 so it is..
 Talking Provocatively backwards
 Ed FIX ME!! D:
 Still on there? ALl the files?
 Format will only zero the data contained on the drive
 Yep, I logged in.
 oh
 Is this via windows?
 Yes
 you can't format linux from windows unless you get special software
 ^
 I clicked Format, then restarted to see if it was still tehre. Grub was still there with ubuntu in start menu so i though id try it and it worked
 you need to boot a cd
 oh ok, so how do i remove linux from my hdd so that i can take that sapce back and have it as "unallocated space" ?
 pop into linux live disc
 Ok
 dam why do i only have 1 laptop :(
 You can either use the gparted on there, or go hardcore (really is easy) and use fdisk while there
 If you installed it through windows, you can simply delete it as you would a software
 I didnt install via windows
 Ah.
 Just use boot disk
 ahh Ed 1 problem, I can't use Kubuntu I get that KDE error (N)
 oh wait, if of the live disk should be fine ?
 Got a spare cd?
 Yep
 gparted's livedisc is good for working with formatting etc
 #!
 ok ill download then
 crunchbang is good for the eeepc
 :D
 this yeh http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php ?
 If you're happy to go command line, you can boot kubuntu into a text only mode
 Ben do you want to remove the partition completely or just modify the amount of space?
 Yep, that's the one
 Sazzad: I just want to remove kubuntu completly off my system, use the space it had (80Gb and have it as unallocated)
 so Ed I just burn the gparted iso to a disk, then pop it in and restart comp ?
 Yep Ben
 ok skeen, then it will have a gui for me to delete linux ?
 :D
 Correcto
 Ben: This might help: http://www.ehow.com/video_4973286_remove-partition.html
 Yay thanks! Do I format or delete http://gparted.sourceforge.net/screens/gparted_7_big.jpg ?
 ooh cheers Sazzad
 I F****d up kubuntu, but want to re-install it on a smaller partition size like 15GB or w/e not 80
 If you just want to modify the amount of allocated space, just use Partition Magic
 Nah I want to delete everything off it first so i can start fresh
 use fedora, Ed is a noob ;)
 i havent had a single problem :D
 Fedora = butt kicking linux
 DarkKrai:  Which version of Fedora?
 11?
 11
 yep
 tpb is back up :D
 WTF Is TPB
 Ed from the video Sazzad linked me to it says i can just delete a partition in windows, would that be as effective as gparted ?
 It's different Ben
 I think gparted is better, but longer and tedious
 pull a creme and 'sudu rm rf /'
 Then just delete it lol
 Sazzad thats what iv been trying to do lol! Ok Gparted it is, I shall boot it up and click delete then should hopefully be nice and dandY!
 Will it remove grub as well
 Good luck!
 I doubt it
 Unless you, in some feaky way, have it part of Kubuntu, then it might. But I don't see any possibility of that happening
 Kubuntu installed it though :S
 Well grub is responsible for loading and transferring control through the OS's kernal software...so maybe. I'd double check with ED
 Oh wait ben, I think it does remove grub
 Grub gets installed the boot sector of the hdd, which is a specific sized part at the beginning on the drive, the  BIOS loads from it and then delegates where next to load
 to clear grub from mbr, in windows you can simply to fdisk /mbr
 type fdisk /mbr in command prompt?
 But you might run into a problem where grub is still there and might cause the computer to not boot any startup disks or windows cd
 Ed will help ya. I gotta run into a meeting.
 Oh :/ I just want it back to normal, so when i turned my laptop on it would just boot straight into windows and not have the list of O/S's like ubuntu, ubuntu recovery, vista, vista recovery etc...
 hmm apparently a command called fixmbr
 I've never needed to put windows back on, so I'm not sure :p
 http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/bootcons_fixmbr.mspx
 guys. why my page says. index.html is not found in this server !
 but im using a index.php
 Motomast3r: Is this Zymic hosting/
 yes
 hmm ok thanks Ed, I'll ignore grub for now and just remove the linux partitions with gparted
 Motomast3r: Please join #hosting
 Click > #hosting
 best laptop for under 1k?
 Try BestBuy
 lol
 Ed would you suggest me having a go at this with Gparted or just wait for my dads mate (works with computers) who i will see on friday when i go to the pub to do for me ?
 go with gparted, just be sure you know which partition you're formatting / removing
 Ok cheers, should i format before removing ?
 Not a bad idea Ben
 Ok cheers for the help Ed, sorry for all the questions i just dont want to screw up :(
 No worries
 Ben hopefully you have 2 pc
 If you screw up, you can come ask ed for help
 well i have a desktop which i could setup but its bare slow lol!
 brb then (I hope)
 lol
 holy shit
 60 years of communism today
 D:
 in china
 so quiet here
 what happened?
 i mean besides 60 years of communism
 60 years of communism is awesome
 communism is epic
 communism is about the best alternative to suckitalism at this point, only if it was implemented without the evil force behind it
 but the final stage is anarchy, but not the kind they had in Russia with all the violence
 what do we have right now?
 well, the final stage of most profound evil
 people are zombified with one liner templates
 either I such your blood, or you suck mine, there is no other game in town
 THAT is what is happening
 well, screw that. Did someone say a while back they are going to work on my site in terms of web design?
 you could get famous and become known to top programmers in the world with your great site design
 :--}
 hey, Mufia, how's life?
 did you manage to get your site up and running?
 FML
 ben? D:
 I can't do it Dolleh D:
 what ben? :(
 your not superman ;) its normal if your not able to do EVERYTHING ben!
 hehe I know, I wish I could though! :D
 buy a cape already!
 Pie`: um, I feel like pointing out, what China has can't really be called communism :p
 Certainly not by the accepted definition
 They just like to call it communism so that the people think they're part of it ;)
 Like African countries that call themselves a Democratic Republic :p
 Communism is at heart based on concepts like common ownership
 And China works on a more western-style capitalist economic model
 It's also hardly a classless society really
 Communism doesn't work.
 Well True communism anyway
 Not with current society, people have to change before it would work
 Marxism originally claimed there would be a transitional period where for a time people can only take from the communal whole in proportion to the amount they contribute
 And that eventually people would stop thinking like they do, and they would just do the work because they enjoy it
 Not sure I believe that
 I don't really believe it would happen
 But that's their answer to it
 hah yeh
 And by "it", I mean one of the most common problems
 Communism works. Osho proved it in Oregon
 Your arguments are invalid. My hair is a bird.
 Can you imagine to live without worrying about money?
 DarkKrai, it is easy to be a clown, the easiest thing in the world
 just do the stuppidest thing that comes to your mind and you are "ok"
 but you need to have courage to deal with REAL life
 lol I can go to 4 different kind of jobs tomorrow! lol crazy bosses
 to bad you have to go prostitue yourself just to get a piece of bread on your table and to afford the basic things
 too bad that was
 hey all
 just say it
 :--}
 it used to be so busy here, eveyone used to blabber ALL sorts of things, and now you are all quiet. what happened?
 mater
 yep
 it isn't always loud in here
 thats how IRC is
 not everyone talks at every moment
 Dolleh!
 actually, it is pretty pleasant to see it more quiet here. cause it used to be just insane with all empty talk all the time

 best thing ever ^ ^ ^  :D
 The generator already gives you a class called container_{size}
 That already tells the body that the maximum size for anything that is put inside is that size and nothing beyond, and that it also must align center.
 This will also make sure all grids you place inside stays intact and not floating out
 you see sazzad and robert, I'm familiar with a software called QuarkXpress [http://8.quark.com/]. it is basically used to design newspaper and magazine pages and is based on columns and rows...
 is this grid thing like that?
 Lmao.
 Quark is ancient
 And no, it's nothing like it
 Jacob:  How so?
 i used it last some 7 years ago :)
 Oh...heh...no machine, grid is not like uark
 Quark**
 Quark is a less modern version of illustrator
 Machine I'll show you a demo of how the grid works. Let me finish integrating it into the CMS
 i didn't even think it existed. but i felt this CSS grid theory sounded quite like dividing the screen into grids [rows and columns]... it'd have made it easier for me to 'get into' this theory :0
 sure :)
 Give me 15-30 mins to integrate it
 this sounds very interesting.
 and anything that can make a webpage look like the designer wanted it to [irrespective of screen res and window size] is a welcome development :)
 high time, they did something about it...
 so sazzad, you're working on a system that will allow the user to customise the number of his columns?
 Oh you've never seen the CMS we're working on. It's basically Microsoft Word for the web
 machine: There is a generator already in use if your after one
 It's all Live edit.
 jacob, where can i get it?
 !google 960 grid generator
 www.google.com/search?q=960+grid+generator
 It's http://960.gs
 Click on Custom CSS
 that full width = 960 remains constant, eh?
 Yes
 BEst size to design for
 i see. a good size for all types of displays - TFT and the like?
 Yep
 great :) thanks a lot to you both for the crash course :)
 np
 It's not even really CSS
 Just using classes
 And a smidgen of CSS
 yeah, i sort of got that :)
 btw, what do you folks think of silverlight?
 Haven't had much to do with it
 Silverlight is ok...not a big fan
 it's also a content delivery platform, no?
 i saw some sample sites and i thought it was impressive - but then i'm really not a web design pro...
 ...and therefore am easily impressed :P
 machine says: Oh wow! Look! <marquee>
 The text moves!
 ...and it blinks too :D
 and says, "ain't it the bestest thing ever?" :D
 ha
 True annoying web style
 i remember those old gif animations when i first encountered the internet...
 machine: another platform limited competitor which generally doesn't provide anything useful that doesn't already exist or that will be introduced in HTML5
 there would be a tiny gif image with the word "new" in it, surrounded by sparkling stars... i was impresses ;)
 sorry, that'd be "impressed"
 Basically, it's just a continuing competitor in the "stop-gap" market before open web standards replace these shitty products ;)
 alex -  yes, i thought; hey, this is just like Flash...
 More like Air I believe
 oh yes, these days it's Air...
 But without the officlaly supported ports to Linux etc
 you admins love linux...
 is it because it's free?
 Linux has it good bad points
 Yes, but not in terms of money
 or is it really better than the others out there...
 I like it, just couldn't use it fror design
 I'm talking about the code being free to distribute, alter, improve etc
 http://vpn.hidemyass.com/vpncontrol/signin load?
 The fact it doesn't cost anything is just icing
 Machine it's going take some more time to set it up. Just ran into a bug in the system
 Loads fine Jack 
 machine: which is "best" is a debatable question, and you won't get a definitive answer
 Loads fine for me too
 Alright ta
 i read a book called Silicon Snake oil by clifford stoll - he wrote a funky mystery-type real-life hacker-capture book called The Cuckoo's Egg...
 But well, there are certainly plenty of architectural things which are better in Linux
 in silicon snake oil he really criticizes linux...
 i don't quite agree with him, but the example of commands he gave in that book looked very user-unfriendly...
 Linux scales in a way other competors can only dream of :p
 machine: commands?  So he's annoyed because it provides a command-line in addition to a mature graphical interface?
 Someone remind me NEVER ever to delete the linux partitions again!
 wait. i have the book. i'll quote some of his commands...
 but do remember it's an old book. linux has evolved greatly since it was written, i'm sure...
 Jack is that your voice in the HMA VPN speed test video?
 The command-line certainly has a real learning curve, and you can't guess it all, but that's why it has man pages which are manuals for each command in there
 So you don't need to remember flags for anything
 Sazzad: I thought it was Emoruffino who made the video, possibly him ?
 you bet he has loads of complaints about tech manuals too :)
 Heh, that's just a case of "I don't want to learn anything, I want to remain ignorant"
 Manuals may not be that well written sometimes, but they're informative
 And these days there's not a great deal that isn't provided as a graphical or menu-based option.
 Ah I see
 That being said, the command line gives you a whole load of power and flexibility that a GUI can rarely match
 Ben : Emo works for Jack?
 Even with alternatives which provide functionality in a GUI environment I would still advocate learning the command line
 the author is an astronomer who became a networks expert when some hackers tried to hack into a network...
 Because some things are just much more efficient there
 Don't think so, but I remember a while ago he was looking for Emo to do some work for him (video) @ Sazzad
 AH I see
 For example, if you know how to use the shell (bash) in Linux, you can trivially do things like
 Regex match all files matching a certain pattern and rename them via a set of rules to something else
 he like, tracked them down and wrote a fine real-life mystery novel about his experience. haven't read that one, but in silicon snake oil, he basically complains that computers are bad...
 So you can in one line of text, rename a select batch of files, whereas the typical GUI method for this is:
 that's why he cites linux and various other stuff, like photoshop hampering creativity and stuff...
 One by one, right click each file and click on "rename", then type the new name, repeat over and over until you're done
 But hey, I guess I can't expect someone who isn't an engineer to appreciate that you can invest some time learning something complicated and find it saves you time in the long run :p
 machine: basically, I think this guy is just a bigot :p
 dudes. I'm SO sorry. the author was talking about Unix. not Linux. sincere apologies...
 i just checked. it's Unix [he talks of a command called gopher...]
 I'm aware of gopher as a protocol
 That was never popular, and died very quickly
 are these related? Linux and Unix?
 To a degree
 Linux was built from scratch from Unix design principles
 And they're both fully POSIX compliant
 this is the gentleman - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Stoll
 So it was written in the 1980's?
 How did you expect that to be relevant today :p
 Oh, no, that one was later, 1995
 no - the hacking book was written back then...
 Still pretty damn dated though ;)
 yes, 1995. yeah, i said it was written a while ago, and Linux must have evolved by now...
 Linux was basically just emerging as a desktop prospect back then
 And Unix certainly hadn't got a great deal in the way of desktop niceties
 no, actually, i could come up with arguements against his complaints about stuff like photoshop, but not against more tech stuff like Unix... so i asked.
 Reading that wiki it does seem like he wasn't that good at predictions :p
 you read that bit about the internet, eh: :)
 That and e-commerce in particular :p
 if you have the time and if you can find it, read Silicon Snake Oil - being into this tech stuff, you're likely to enjoy it more...
 or enjoy coming up with arguements against his statements...
 That depends, I do get annoyed sometimes if they're fairly innacurate
 I read a book recently which had a tech theme
 no, it just seems he is a part of the old guard.
 AAAAHHHHH!!!!!!
 And the eventual premise was about "teams" performing industrial espionage trying to access the internet traffic of other countries
 Because in this hypothetical scenario quantum computers were in use, traditional encryption was easily broken in seconds
 So he said that the countries were using one-time pads to secure internet traffic, and the teams were trying to access these
 But the thing is... they were suggesting that they would have a one-time pad that could be used as a stream cipher
 umm i haven't read the one on hacking [the cuckoo's egg]. it seems you're talking about that, right?
 And that only works if the one-time pad is larger than the amount of data going across it in its life time
 No, by someone else
 So he was suggesting that they had mutliple copies of a one-time pad larger than the cumulative data going across the whole internet
 I guess most people didn't notice that, but I found it somewhat annoying given I noticed that was fairly impossible ;)
 anyway. it's an old book. 1995, in terms of computing technology is like a jurassic era...
 engaging chat i had. have to log off now. will drop by later. bye :)
 I still find it really quite odd

 may i ask why brandon?
 Well, atleast the colour scheme does
 Colours are shitty :)
 Thats it?
 And mass amount of text on front page :p
 thats a place holder
 Place holder?
 it wouldn't really be that much text
 Oh, so dummy content is all you needed to say :P

 Your contact me button is slightly off
 ah, higher is it?
 Perry: you might want to re-do the nav bar on your site
 the way you've done it is kinda poor imo
 yea, needs to be lowered
 Just one thing, For the search box, it would look better if you didnt gradient the box on the rims. But idk
 no not that
 its the fact that the text is done in images
 so each time you hover over the text
 theres a split secnod where the new image loads
 and people with slow internet, thats gonna be very noticeable
 yeah ill add preloading to the images
 you could have exactly the same job but done in css
 You should use hava
 java*
 Pie` there are gradients on the text
 thats why its in images
 they aren't that noticable tbrh :p
 its quite noticable difference in plain next w. no gradients
 Does anyone know how to get flash installed on a linux server?

 heh bet he's one of the people at school who brags about having Linux :P
 Ben2: I don't  bother bragging, poeple at my school don't know what, "a linux" is
 yeh same at mine
 I got into some arguments over time at school/college, but that was just because there were people who said OSX was the be-all and end-all of operating systems and everything else sucks :p
 But I didn't bring it up myself
 silly fanboys ;)
 hehe ;)
 Was OSX based on unix ?
 OSX was yes, older versions weren't
 Which is why OSX is cool. ;)
 But OSX has Darwin as a core which is a reworking of FreeBSD I believe
 I think it's that BSD flavour
 Alex: amarok works with ipods doesn't it ?
 answer: yes it does
 Older versions of amarok certainly did
 http://amarok.kde.org/wiki/Media_Device:IPod
 I'm not sure how much of the new one does
 They brought back media device support recently
 It was a GSoC project
 Well, maybe he does :P
 I would have guessed it did, libipod generally makes it easy enough once you've got a media device framework

 i shouldn't have eaten all that pizza
 but ti was so damn good ;)
 Did you save a piece?
 Nope.
 Or do you mean you ate all of it!?
 all of it
 was only a 9" :<
 What size pizza are we talking about?
 Oh right, yeah that's understandable :p
 I normally get 12" and eat all that
 but wasnt hungry today :D
 What topping?
 just cheese + tomato
 Boring :p
 stuffed crust
 Pepperoni topping is win.
 Quite often tend to get a 16" and split it with someone here
 Works out reasonably well
 families that eat a 12" between 4
 freak me out sorta
 Haha

 Ben2: when using chrome do you find that every so often flash applications start using a lot of memory?
 and CPU
 s/chrome/any browser because flash is so shit/
 Yeh like bare, and sometimes it just crahses :(
 never rly happened in firefox
 but sometimes in chrome it has a complete cow
 I have had it happen
 In older versions of flash especially
 like 50% cpu and > 500mb RAM
 You would quite often have flash go nuts and take up 100% of one core
 lold
 worst firefox ever did for me
 was 1.2gb of RAM
 thats what pushed me to chrome
 Why would "I want low memory usage" push you to chrome :p
 The architecture is memory hungry, because of the multi-process model
 also chrome has lots more browsing space
 loads pages faster
 and doesn't pause every 5 secs like firefox dos
 "more browsing space"?
 yeah
 mroe space for the pages to appear in
 You can cut firefox down to a minimal appearance too
 the actual window pane is taller
 but then you loose stuff
 and ahve to faff around with settings
 faff?
 lol
 Eww

 Sheer laziness getting a bot to do that
 robert pyDelphi doesn't handle the calculations

 Not sure how, new client Alex
 Quassel, not sure on that
 You'd hope it had something
 It does probably
 Still, as I've said before, Konversation goes stable on KDE4 soon :)
 ew kde4
 And that's a nicer client
 Pie`: pointless comment, anything specific?
 kde4 is bloated and klunky
 Also make sure you're talking about recent builds, pre-KDE4.3 is ignored
 KDE4 can be cut down to a smaller memory footprint than gnome or KDE3, Pie`
 Pie`: stats or it didn't happen
 It's only as "bloated" as you let it become
 Though, I tend to prefer the term, functional
 Because it points out how much that "bloat" offers in terms of the rich functionality in kdelibs
 !time Robert
 Time for Robert is: Mon Oct 5 23:33:12 2009
 He's even working correctly :p
 Heh, no need to be so shocked ;)
 Well, he's been broken for months now
 And I could never work out why
 And have now done it in 15? minutes
 Now for mysql, that's the real killer
 The thing is, KDE is a great ecosystem for development.  It is sooo much nicer to work with than the plethora of separate Gnome-family libraries
 And that's why KDE quite often has the best applications in class, whereas most of the Gnome system relies on simply GTK+ applications
 Not that working with GTK+ compares to the ease of use you get via Qt4
 The main drive for developers to go the hard route with GTK+ is now gone since Qt4 started being available under the terms of the LGPL
 I just think in the end, a real incentive for developers to join in and much more investment in developer days than the Gnome foundation provides
 Is going to pay dividends
 And Gnome is already somewhat stagnated, which is why they're considering a 3.0
 Although, I guess I didn't need to answer "ew kde4" with that much reasoning ;)
 One expects someone who'll come out with that randomly to already have his opinion far beyond reason ;)
 I was talking about Konversation though, you might try it now it's in release candidate, TheOracle
 Windows version?
 There might be later
 Because I'm not going to bother with compiling on Windows...
 You're using Quassel on Windows?
 Interesting choice, I've never really liked Quassel
 Ah
 The whole separate quassel server, and quassel client business
 Well Ben was using it and I took a look at it
 I don't want any of that
 Well I use the monolithic client
 Although they sell it as a feature
 which doesn't bother with core / client
 Its like the normal IRC client
 It's just the two stuck together, TheOracle
 Yes
 The added pointless complication is still there
 I agree... but its a good client
 its the only one with web page preview I've seen yet, unless you can show me another
 besides the mac one
 Is that suddenly a major feature? :p
 which I can't use obviously
 I don't really want any of that mess
 If I want it, I would much rather it was a plugin and not in the core
 The whole preview system just means that someone can wipe away my whole backlog of chat in three lines
 Plus it's never guaranteed to be stable, and some websites people link I don't /want/ a preview of :p
 Alex it's on-hover
 and which 3 lines would that be?
 I was referring to how the mac client handles things like youtube links
 ah yes
 By replacing them with youtube videos inside the client
 That is horrible
 Quassel doesn't do that
 Only for webpages...
 and on-hover
 I don't even want it on-hover
 If I'm going to visit it, I'll visit it
 If I'm suspicious of it, then I'm just not going to go near it in the first place
 So I rather don't see the point
 Except as something else to crash... oh wait that's a bad thing :p

 Plymouth;
 The main city in the Southwest of England located on the south coast of Devon near the Cornish border. Plymouth is home is to one of the largest naval bases in Western Europe and home to far too many chavs.
 Following intense bombing in WWII, the city centre was rebuilt by stoned and drug addicted urban planners who had a fetish for ugly concrete buildings. Most of the city centre and Union Street is now inhabited by total wankers who seem to like the disgusting surroundings.
 Plymouth is also where the Pilgrims left from before heading to that nasty place called America.
 I live in Plymouth and it would be nice if we rebuilt the city centre and exiled the chavs to a sinking boat in the middle of the Atlantic.
 Urban failed.

 LOL p3
 Old-skool ed
 Heh, planning on doing anything with it, Ed?
 Can't imagine it's terribly useful really
 Fixing the charger first Alex :P... the end is all spiced, bits of wire hanging out. I have my laptop charger which is 19v, where as their charger is 18.5v, not sure if I should use it or not.
 There probably is some tolerance on it, but probably not best to experiment :p
 Yeah, don't really want to kill it before I get to use it :P
 I might just scalpel off the cable sheath and rebind it, wrap it back up in insulating tape
 What about a lower voltage Alex, thing that would have any negative effects, or just be slightly under powered / take longer to charge?
 Well the ampage will be different
 And I don't know whether it also converts the frequency of the AC.
 I can think of reasons it would go wrong, but I don't know if they apply :p
 Just looked at the end, the connector is wrong any hoo :P

 Does anyone know of any good remote file editors for Windows?
 as in, the editor grabs file from say an FTP server and when you save it uploads it ?
 Yes...but it also needs the tree feature that updates as files are updated on the server
 phpDesigner has that feature
 but its a very large app
 Do you know anything like it for XML, xslt or xschema?
 AFAIK, phpDesigner isn't for PHP only, as the name implies
 Does it report errors when content on a document is not valid?
 IDK
 I don't really use it
 I was looking for something like Oxygen but a bit more advanced and faste

 i just watched it where theyve gone through the gate. And the episode ended
 and what did you think of it?
 confused. Tis like two diff times?
 Yeah, they kept showing the past up till the go on the ship, and after
 yeah.
 it was just to give the back story, explain characters and how they got there... true they could have started at the beginning and kept going, but this way it makes you piece it together as you go along

 What dont you like about the footer? Besides the form field which is hideous :P
 title would be good
 What Ben?
 <title>
 oo did i not add it? :P
 nope
 Ha stupid me

 I just noticed it cos my tab says http://...
 Oh and a doctype :)
 Color scheme? Does that blue look okay?
 I like it, looks professional.
 Alright. Thank you. Alex what about the footer?
 Well, that's something I would just scrap ;p
 The list is dull, text is a bit too small, the random switch to left-align
 Yeah. There added doctype, title, scrapped facebook and footer
 look better?

 Hey Ed
 Hey Ben
 I find BT's recent broadband advertising a bit dishonest
 The one where he's out looking at houses, and they make a comparison against the guy showing them around with his laptop, in someone else's house
 So that'll likely be 3G, and then they say home broadband is faster
 No shit, it's not really an honest comparison because most people would think it's a comparison of two home internet connections
 lol
 they compared home broadband to 3G?
 Only if you apply logic to the situation
 They never actually specify
 Alex: the pitch isn't designed for people who know what they're talking about ;)
 I know, that's why it's dishonest, Pie` :p
 They expect their customers to be people who don't know a thing about networking
 That's what I was thinking
 The thing is, the overall impression people would get I think is, "BT is faster than other home internet providers", but they've "cleverly" put it in a situation when the slow example is likely a 3G dongle
 So I think it's a bit dishonest composition because you have to work that bit out yourself
 But then that's advertising for you
 very true, alex.
 But then why do you care so much Alex? It's not as if it affects you really :p
 Care so much?  No one had said anything for a while
 It was a topic ;)

 got bored in IT at school today, played air hockey with my friend via bluetooth :p
 hahaha
 productive.
 on cell phones, Pie`?
 ipod touch
 oooh
 i didnt know bluetooth allowed instant interactions like that
 there was the smallest amount of lag
 but it was still very nice
 yeah lol
 Alex: would local wi-fi be faster than bluetooth ?
 for sending minute amounts of data
 I'm not really sure about latency on bluetooth, but well, you can play that kind of game over the internet via wi-fi so you'd think local wifi wouldn't have noticeable lag
 but wi-fi would have more of a distance to travel ?
 because it has to go from client -> router -> client
 bluetooth is just client -> client
 Is bluetooth 3.0 being used yet?
 Well, the important thing is signal latency
 Pie`:  Did you jailbreak your iTouch?
 Not yet, as far as I am aware there is no working jailbreak for 3G
 there is for firmware 3.1 on 2G
 Also if you want the software update for 3.0 let me know
 I've got 3.0 for 2G
 but it doesn't appear to work for 3G
 Did you pay for it?
 No :p
 :-D
 I barely ever pay for stuff
 unless it's for a noble cause ^__6
 ^__^
 Apple is fairly stupid with the update
 have yu got 3.0 for 3G ?
 Yup
 gimmie :D
 I used the hold shift and click restore trick
 Yeah I know about that
 I'm suprised apple haven't removed that
 it'd solve their jailbreak problems for a few months
 Right after I installed 3.0, Apple asked me if I wanted to upgrade to 3.1 for free
 uh, noty? :D
 Mine came with 3.1 :(
 Why downgrade?
 3.0 jailbreak is prolly gonna be out first
 3.0 jb is already out
 You want it?
 YES
 Let me find it
 Somewhere on my computer
 if you havent moved it from the apple update dir
 its in application data
 No you would need to use redsn0w
 C:\Documents and Settings\YOUR USERNAME\Application Data\Apple Computer\iTunes\iPod Software Updates
 So it's not done through itunes
 don't I need to be on 3.0 firmware
 and them jailbreak 3.0
 then *
 I thought you were on 3.0
 no im on 3.1
 I have 3.0 as well if you want it
 Whoooooooooooooooooooooooooo am going to N-Dubz concert!!! :D
 Dolleh see that? :D
 Sazzad: please
 ew win7
 http://www.cracked.com/blog/using-windows-7-may-lead-to-murder/
 I lol'd.
 Evening all :)
 GrRRR
 HOMG BEN :O
 I use win7
 Not a bad OS
 It's between vista and XP imo
 vista benig the shitty end
 being *
 XP is great
 ^
 Yup
 Windows ME, best OS ever made
 But I like some features of win7
 [/SARCASM]
 But still, i want my damn install disk for 7!!
 Heh
 Perry:  Did you pay for win7?
 No its the last Beta that microsoft offered for DL
 I didn't mind Win95 back in the day :p
 heh, microsoft tried to get me to download the first release candidate for win7 through their activeX download manager
 Win98 was better, and then it all went downhill from there ;)
 I was like, "fuck this"
 got the download URL and got it in twice the speed in firefox
 Yah their manager is crap
 back to the drawing board. Now i either wait till they release it and buy it, or go DL it
 but im skeptical about DL, tons of viruses and whatnot
 and aussie blogger has already posted a massive flaw in UAC
 and microsoft said they aren't going to patch it
 That's why you do a virus run on the files contents
 the blogger even released the source code, and example program
 Perry:  Try registering for MSDN. They gave me 2 free license and the software for free
 Sazzad: did you pay?
 Nope FREE
 I'm already registered
 Sazzad you lil' pirate :p
 Nope its legal
 Pie`: and these kind of problems are probably going to stick around until they finally get the balls to break backwards compat
 They gave me Windows Mobile 6.5
 https://e-academy.com/IT_MSDNAA_main.cfm
 its beautiful
 Hah, if only the underlying system wasn't stillborn, Perry :p
 Even Microsoft don't like it
 I know
 And it has a lovely browser based on I think IE5?
 IE 2.0 was epic
 The new nokia smartphones are looking very interesting
 Alex I cooked it up beofre I installed
 took out alot of their shit
 Underneath they're a full Linux distro
 Including IE
 Opera Mobile ftw :D
 So you could theoretically port almost any Linux app to the Nokia phone
 Support both GTK+ and Qt development
 WOW now MSDNAA is offering free XP SP3
 Which is miles better than any existing mobile dev platform
 Where are you finding this Sazaad?
 Including Android and WM
 hahahaha this is so funny
 I've convinced loads of people that my friend who is kinda overwight
 he's rather plump, and he weighs like 14st
 telling everoyn eh's anorexic XD
 Tasteful...
 hes going along with it as well :D
 https://msdn03.e-academy.com/elms/Security/Login.aspx?campus=rit_ect
 Perry:  My school offers free access to their service. I get a whole list of free Microsoft products including server systems pro
 Pie`:  That phpDesigner software you recommended kicks ass!
 Heh
 I don't like it too much
 So I got PDT
 :D
 Trial or pro?
 I've got phpDesigner pro
 Sazaad: do you need special access?
 (Free, obviously..)
 but I didn't like it
 Are you a college student perry?
 No
 Well they give schools the ability to register and then the server adminsitrators of that school grants access to students
 Ahh
 Oh well
 BRB gotta finish work for a meeting thats later today
 While you're away Sazzad, we'll be cracking into your computer.
 Heh: http://www.cracked.com/article_15670_25-most-baffling-toys-from-around-world.html
 MSDN disabled all DL's for windows 7 ;(
 Thank you MSDN, so much!
 lol
 damn MSDN is 10x as expensive as ADC
 I still have access to download win7 x86 and x643
 x64**
 Sorry x83
 I think
 Gah I mean x86 what the hell is 83
 lol
 will you check?
 It's x86
 Let me take a ss
 I would say x86_64 over x64 by the by
 x64 bugs me
 I mean, we don't call x86 x32 do we?
 WHat are the differences?
 I always DL x86 cuz i install them on my Mac
 x86 is an architecture, x86 typically means normal Intel compatible 32-bit
 x86_64 is the 64-bit variant
 It's still x86, but 64-bit x86
 ahh
 so x86 can run on any intel?
 And most AMDs are x86 as well, it's just intel originated
 32-bit will also run on 64-bit architectures as well
 But not the other way around
 Since the 64-bit version is a superset of 32
 Perry:  http://i34.tinypic.com/25ul2fn.png
 I believe 64-bit also uses a bit more energy than 32-bit
 Varies on what it's being used for
 It can be more or less efficient
 Once you've got >4GB of RAM it becomes entirely 64-bit dominated because you either get more RAM available or you avoid the overhead of PAE
 dang.
 that sucks.
 i'm gonna make a keyboard shotrcut.

 Alex: you a nevermidn the buzzcocks fan ?

 Hah

 Not again
 silly router
 Cisco Linksys?
 Belkin :p
 Worse
 But better than NetGear
 theres something up with our line
 routers die in like a year
 buy a new router, its fine for a while then after a year it just dies
 Heh. Buy a Linksys N router next time
 It'll probably kill that one too ;)
 we hjad a linksys router before, can't remember what one
 I tried to kill it, no luck. We had competitions on who breaks through the router security first. We decided to break through the neighbors Linksys. Idiot had WEP only
 we use WPA-TSK
 PSK?
 LOl
 If so, that's been broken
 Yeah I think that's what he meant
 In case you're interested
 WPA-PSK can be bypassed in 10 minutes
 hah yeah, PSK
 :p
 Damn...need to learn how
 WPA2, WPA-AES are safe options
 ...for now
 we don't have them :(
 we got WPA-PSK, 128bit WEP, 64bit WEP, and WPA
 Breaking router security is not terribly impressive though
 Generally the best you hope for is to stop the average teenager :p
 If someone actually wants to break into a wireless network, they generally can
 It wouldn't matter where I live anyway, people round my way are technologically illiterate
 If you're worried about security, don't have wifi
 I don't use wi-fi myself, 
 I'd rather run 30m of cable round my house
 Cat-6 is faster anyway
 Id rather have optic fibre ;)
 My wifi doesn'n reach outside my yard, haha.
 doesn't*
 my router si like 4ft away from me where I am right now :D
 hey TO
 hey all

 hehe ok then ;) I still don't understand why you don't like my link, I mean Dolleh likes it!
 and so do I, no doubt Brandon doesn't
 can't be that bad, Ed probably likes it. He may even have the album!
 Call me funny, but I like music with a bit of substance
 R&B ?
 Whereas Ed likes a 10 second drum beat sample set on repeat for 10 minutes
 with some rapping :D
 No, I don't think he likes rapping so much
 I think he just likes the same repetetive drum beat from what he's posted before :p
 ahh ok
 neh I don't think ed likes rap
 But rapping is often very shallow anyways - it's got this reputation for being meaningful expression, but let's be honest - it's got less than most.
 But rap is good...
 Especially the mainstream stuff, incredibly tedious
 It's just a sign that they can't hold a tune, and can only follow simple time signatures :p
 eminem ?
 eminem <3
 Eminem varies in lyrics, I'm not a fan of the genre really but some of it is alright in terms of the actual lyrics behind it
 But well, it's mainly gangsta-rap that is incredibly shallow
 <3 Eminem
 Hard to even call it one dimensional, maybe half dimensional?
 Can you rap ?
 Does it matter?
 I've some classical training as a musician
 :O
 :O
 It's not terribly impressive, grade 1 in an instrument could say the same :P
 I'm grade three in two instruments
 sing us a song alex! :P
 i used to play the guitar
 But the idea I was getting is, I can read or write music, I understand pitch, musical styles, time signatures
 Whether I can rap or not doesn't really seem so important in whether I can criticise music
 hehe
 Dolleh has good music!
 Alex, Ever played a piece in 3.5 / 8 ??
 :O shht shht ben
 =[
 No, is that important too? :P
 Haha no, avoid that one!
 Silly modern composers...
 I can imagine it being... every so slightly irritating ;)
 ever*
 more so, it is pure laziness in my opinion, to not just write 2/8 + 3/16
 Night everyone
 If you wake up Ben with a stiff neck and after dreaming about eating giant marshmellows... you've just eaten your pillows.
 I've played some annoying ones, but well, not too much
 Because I didn't pick those ones for stuff I played myself
 So it was only when it turned up in orchestra (compulsary if you had music lessons at school)
 But... well, since I rarely turned up one week in eight for practice
 If I was ending up playing one of those, it was in an actual performance, because that was basically the only thing I attended
 Those were fun pieces to pick up in practice before the event ;)
 But let's be fair here
 Hehe school orchestras are a waste of time, tbf.
 Orchestra at school was dull as shit
 Plus, I was alto sax
 And it was very rare for them to have an arrangement with a piece for us
 So we quite often ended up with something like the cello part
 In bass cleff
 Pie`?
 So if I every was in practice and we started a new piece
 We didn't join in on the first attempt
 Because we were busy transposing the sheet music :p
 ever* bah, did that one twice
 I was never really good at bass cleff, certainly not enough to read it as I was going, but it was never important :p
 I would have to remind myself how to work back to treble now
 Been a while since I played anything
 *clef
 Been a while since I wrote clef too :p
 Yeh learning a new one is always difficult. It's too easy to fall into the trap of thinking of it in terms of one you know, such as treble.
 Lmao: http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=1202939761476
 I'm trying to learn my fourth clef atm. It's not going so well :p
 Heh, they do put a clef on bagpipe music, my Dad got one for his last birthday because he was born on burns night
 But we can't work out why
 Because we've checked with his teacher, and bagpipe players as a rule don't know what pitch they're playing in
 They just tune to match the lead bagpipe player, the pitch he's got is arbitrary
 It's only the change in note that is standard to "songs" if you can call them that :p
 The actual notes could be anything
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBKBI7DOLHA :)
 YouTube - Scotland the Brave (Bagpipes) -- Rated 5.0 Stars
 Oh, and because they don't have any sharp/flat notes on them
 Strange they put a clef on the music then.
 People take music that has sharps or flats, and just don't write them on :p
 You think it would just be like percussion.
 Denoting untuned
 The fact they're now a semitone out doesn't matter apparently ;)
 Makes it more modal ;)
 I.e. sound like bagpipe music 
 Anyhow, unfortunate 9:30 lecture for me tomorrow.

 like, automatically.
 does anyone know what exactly a WBMP is ?

 oop.s
 anyone know if i can host irc stuff on my server?
 oops
 i'm gona go to the hosting room.
 What is it?
 a chatroom.
 like this.
 lol. aparently i can only add a channel on this server..
 You can embed mibbit's widget appleuser 
 yeah, i have, on my radio station site..
 thats all cool then.:)
 Chatrooms we disallow are those that are hosted on the hosting its self, embedded we have no problems with as it uses no server resources apart from the initial page load.
 cool:)
 so, i can setup a chatroom on the irc.zymic, and embed the mibbit client on my page?
 oh, no need. lol i realised i can host it on my paid server.:P
 maniclive.com
 [:)
 Yup appleuser 
 :)
 thanks ed.
 so.... anyone have anything interesting happen today?
 - yup, i'm bored.
 I had a stale scone, does that count? ;)
 pretty much.
 i dropped a drumstick.
 thats about it.
 Chicken or the percussion kind?
 percussion.:)
 Or Turkey, forgot about those.
 *turkey
 lol.
 I learnt microtime() is better for uploading images then time()
 I could go for some turkey twizzlers...
 Jacob, unique names?
 yum yum
 awh, man, yummy.:)
 :P
 uniz timestamp
 unix*
 so in case two people upload in the same second
 I was think of using uniqid()
 Why would that matter Jacob? :P -- You're using them as tokens?
 When they are uploaded, the filename is changed to the timestamp instead
 Just create a unique string, then check it doesn't exist in a loop
 And if two people upload at the same time and pull the same time() then one gets overwritten
 It's still possible they'd upload the file at the same milisecond
 you guys talk about stuff i have no idea about.
 Ed: Still, millsecond is highly unlikely
 :)
 i say do what ed says, to shut him up if nothing else.:)
 Ed - I've often wondered how to be certain of that
 $image_name=microtime(TRUE).'.'.$extension;  
 $newname="images/".$image_name; 
 So the top one creates the "unique" timestamped name
 And the second one places it
 http://pastesite.com/10940 is my current best idea
 into the images folder
 But even that has a few miliseconds that someone else could get in there
 Jacob, hardly, you could hash it against the file name too, but it's still not going to be as fool proof as a unique string and checked against the database.
 Robert: No FTP commands allowed.
 :P
 Jacob what?
 Ed: I looked at that, but this was only going to be for me and someone else to test - so for now it's good.
 Robert: file_put_contents - Is that not using FTP protocols?
 No
 It's optimised for wherever it is
 And as this is on a local server...
 Especially as I haven't given it an ftp user or pass
 I'd hate to think of PHP having to hack my server every time

 i'll set it to like, 75% contrast?
 Why not just use solid #666 or #333
 Still, it would be worse if he tried to emulate the singing in Sugar

 nobody can ever win the game

 you can only loose the game
 You know, you aren't even following the actual rules anyway
 what are the rules?

 aiight
 The storage system is pretty simple
 It consists of keys of PIDs (integers for Page IDs) and a list containing the source file and title as a value
 all serialized through YAML
 woah. funny video...: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zcOFN_VBVo
 YouTube - LIPDUB - I Gotta Feeling (Comm-UQAM 2009) -- Rated 5.0 Stars
 I plan on changing the code administrative if/else coding to a class
 The serving script just uses the PID retrieved from a GET request and then matches it from the data storage, then constructs the page and serves it :)
 brb
 Don't leave us TheOracle!

 While you're away appleuser, we'll be cracking into your computer.
 i like the sBo script.
 :)
 bk.
 *sBot
 dont think sBot know's i'm on a mac though, practically inhackable for most people. but not totally.
 :)
 The short URIs you see are just RewriteRules formed to match the location of the serve script and its PID
 and the page's PID*
 appleuser: increasingly the attack vector is not anything in the core OS, since user-data is often as important as subverting a machine
 Safari is getting notorious for being a target for attacks
 fair point.
 /abc/ is actually /cgi-bin/serve.py?id=5 if I remember correctly
 well, i use opera.
 :)
 Similarly, if there's a vulnerability in that
 It tends to be cross-platform
 and even then, i got little snitch to alert me to any unusual network activity.:)
 Well, in the case of browser problems, you don't find out until too late
 Because the intent is to snatch any stored details like passwords for online banking
 And that would occur before you could intervene were it to happen
 i never store passwords.
 Just an example
 :)
 good example.
 However /abc/ is a directory aswell, allowing for files to be stored under /abc/ :)
 but yeah, i know that passwords can be snatched, hence why i prefer to not store them.:)
 oh TheOracle, I got an error last night in Pythot, dunno what it means :p
 k
 TypeError: 'module' object is not callable
 tell me in memoserv
 because I have to go
 oh
 that was from, sock = PyIRCSocket("irc.zymic.com", 6667)
 you're trying to call an imported file as a function
 you want to do file.function()
 since function() is inherited from file
 PyIRCSocket.__construct() ?
 i mean
 __init__
 __construct is php :p
 Pie`, I'll help you later
 I really have to go
 alright.
 anyone know a decent guestbook script?
 what do you mean, "guestbook script" ?
 yeah.
 I asked what do you mean, not, do you mean.
 He means a basic comments script
 For people to say what they think of his site
 oh that'd be really easy appleuser
 come talk to me over in #php
 okay.
 any ravers here ?
 so much win
 its form 1995 :D
 Let me just screen shot and sum
 kl..
 i had 141gb, out of 50gb bandwidth the other day...:P
 Bandwidth is easy to exceed, it's a not physical limit, you just use too much
 With memory, I only have so much
 lol. i only had my site online 3 days. and it was only like, a 5mb folder for the whole site.
 fair..
 pie` are you okay?
 I really dont know..
 wouldnt worry about it... as long as u feel okay..
 thing is, I match up to the symptoms of all the disorders
 and?
 i match up to depression, but i'm not.
 i actuallly went to my doc.
 if u really were all those things, you'd probably be dead by now.:)
 anyway....
 i must go, thans for your php help...x:)

 hello!
 here, there is someone from technical support?
 èëè èç ðîññèè õîòÿ áû=)
 probably holler at Ed, but join #hosting if it's hosting related probably
 Mark2, "holler" have you changed race? ;)
 thank you
 hi guys
 hello!
 Have I told yall about my latest php project?
 yep, no need to repeat it
 http://afterlight.netai.net is the location of my project
 just check it out, I updated it
 CSS_Guru: I've been wanting to talk to you.
 Your CMS is vulnerable.
 how?
 Want a demo?
 yes please
 I won't do anything malicious.
 ok
 what are you gonna do?
 Only add a string to one of the pages.
 k
 CSS_Guru: http://afterlight.netai.net/index.php
 lol
 Pwnt
 how do i fix that?
 Don't rely on cookie data being safe CSS_Guru 
 ed scared him ;)
 so is there away around that?
 Jesus Ed
 You crashed Quassel
 ed, how do i make it safe?
 The popup turned Quassel modal when I hovered on the link
 It's the way you deal with authentication CSS_Guru, setting a cookie is not sufficient as they can be easily spoofed.
 Need to have a way to root out fake sessions
 on tutorials, It showed a login with cookies...
  beside me on put overhand go warning! http://muravejnik.99k.org/  that me with this do?
 Possibly a session database...
 Sessions are a better way as they can't be set locally (though with shared hosting it is possible to get session data)
 can I use both cookie and session data?
 You can yes
 hmm
 brb
 Don't leave us Ed!
 not this kid?
 I need a more robust login system aswell
 Currently using HTTP authentication... hah
 I never heard of cookie spoofing
 Its very common
 damn youtube tutorials!
 lol
 what if I add a password to the cookie?
 That can be spoofed with some clever hacking and nullbytes I assume.
 You should probably have sessions recorded locally
 register_session($username) ?
 CSS_Guru: That will help BUT if there's an XSS vulnerability, someone will be able to steal the user's password
 register_session is deprecated in favour of $_SESSION['sessionname'] = 'session data';
 With SQL you have to worry about SQL injection
 Truthfully, nothing is completely safe
 bedtime, night zymics!
 nn Dolleh
 I used anti- mysql injection...I think
 night TO
 Now correct me if I'm wrong, but is this not ridiculously early to be going to sleep Dolleh?
 good night Dolleh
 thnx mark2
 CSS_Guru: Only in some places, you still had possible injections due to trusting cookie data
 but I cant fix that by using sessions also?
 You shouldn't really rely on them, but they're a lot safer.
 what should I rely on then?
 You should validate then if you can do that, sanitize
 *can't
 im lost...
 :o 
 You don't deserve good night Dolleh, it's morning ;)
 BOOHOO ;_;
 mean bastard!!!
 %Dolleh (Dolleh@face.in.a.bowl.of.saimin) has left #zymic (*yawns* <insert awesome quitmessage of doom here>)
 I think I give up on making php logins and such, its wayy too unsafe.
 CSS_Guru: While trusting session data is a lot safer than cookie data, there's still room for manipulation, so before you do it, you should check it is what you want. Sanitization is stripping any bad characters from a string and making them safe again.
 Don't be defeatist.
 Just remember the rule of thumb, "never trust user supplied data"
 I never learned sanitization.
 just like a car, I'd seek more opinions than Ed's tbh
 oooooooooooooh!
 Mark2 you troll ;)
 fight fight fight!
 you got me
 http://ssh.sresp.co.cc/abc :)
 Todo:
 CSS_Guru: mysql_real_escape_string() is a form of sanitization
 you know though CSS_Guru, Ed has only been learning PHP a few months
 Sanatization & Preview :)
 sanatization first though
 uhhh
 can I get an example of sanitizing or whatever?
 $str = mysql_real_escape_string($str); --  Simplest form.
 That's MySQL sanitization.
 To "sanitize" is to clean
 I used that for the login...
 %u POUND
 Jesus, where is pyDelphi?
 %u POUND
 U+00A3 POUND SIGN (Â£)
 ty
 CSS_Guru: Yes, but you didn't use it for the cookie data
 ya lost me...
 Lines 114 - 117 is a perfect example
 $username comes from the cookie yet goes straight into the mysql_query without be sanitized.
 brb gotta help my mom
 Oh, don't do anything I wouldn't do CSS_Guru
 back
 so $username = mysql_real_escape_string($_COOKIE['Afterlight']) would fix it?
 just give up and bake cookies, CSS_Guru 
 got a killer recipe I can give you if you like
 stfu
 the secret is cranberries in the mix
 get some friends mark2, since the way your acting screams "I piss off everyone!"
 CSS_Guru get a sense of humor...
 that's why I bake the cookies, to apologise for what comes out when I talk
 Im too serious atm to be making jokes
 Then don't lash out at him, just say calmly "Mark2: I'm being serious."
 Not that hard...
 For the injection CSS_Guru won't solve being able to login as an admin though
 Mark2 amuses me, just thought I'd add that in; ;)
 awaa?
 CSS_Guru: All I did to do what I did was spoof a cookie named 'Afterlight' with the contents 'admin'
 yup, but I didn't know that was possible
 It's sent in a header, it's the browser which sends it
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Setting_a_cookie
 how would you make a login then?
 With sessions
 what if I used a combination of both, or would that clash?
 You can do that, that's how 'remember me' tends to work.
 $_SESSION = $login_username;, is that good Ed?
 It would be $_SESSION['username'] = $login_username; if anything CSS_Guru 
 oo ok
 gotta get use to it...
 should I use one for the password to make it safer?
 Not advisable to store your password
 :) http://grab.by/8Fs
 so yea if someone sees Jacob, tell him to text me please =]
 just memo him
 I'll fix pyd in the meantime
 hey guys
 Ed, I can't seem to figure out how php sessions work...
 sorry, but RTFM
 read the fuckin manual?
 The manual is your friend :)
 nah
 :|
 Thats what its for, for reference...
 Besides, the PHP manual is probably one of the largest
 php seems very insecure, after reading all the stories of hacking...
 if I cant even make a secure login, what can I make? lol
 straight from google: 16,500,000 for php hacking.
 Perhaps PHP should stand for Pretty Hard to Protect
 Bull, it's only insecure if you write it insecurely.
 there are more ways to write php insecurely, than there is to write it securely, if you know what i mean...
 It's because it's taught badly, you picked up that cookie technique from a tutorial, that tutorial was badly written.
 There's a lot of sub-par php tutorial which teach terrible techniques.
 I thought that was what cookies were for
 Cookies are for retaining data over multiple page loads 
 They also taste good.
 omg...
 ED. Wana play some CoD4? ^_^
 I will :D
 Not at the moment Jeyrad :P
 Nuuuu

 Elliott: You need to build a bot
 ah..
 how do i do that?
 Google is your friend
 okay...:)
 google apps?
 I must run an internal diagnostic.
 okay.
 Elliott: If you have a bot and wish to test, please move to #bots
 okay.
 morning Ed, Dolleh, Alex, Jeyrad. 
 php bots?
 page.netai.net
 i just downloaded software to build a bot using a GUI.
 eww
 Elliott: Not possible.

 To build one, you need to use a programming language such as PHP.
 well, im making one now.

 what is this car you speak of? Is it that damn tele-fone that Alexander cam up with? Damn his devil's machinery to hell!
 could be a few things
 what kind of car is it?
 Pontiac Bonneville
 automatic im assuming
 yes
 i would say pop the hood, start it up, rev it for a few minutes and see if you see any leaks under the hood and possibly underneath the engine
 ok, thanks
 sounds like its got a leak and basically spattering on the engine block, evaporating and sending the fumes through the vents into the car
 JaXm: hows the eveony deal going ?
 goin good
 releasing a new design soon... more features and should increase our revenues/user base
 JaXm link please? I need some musical stimulus
 and I've lost the link
 hello:)
 [:)
 http://evonyradio.com
 http://evonyradio.com/v2/
 ta
 is the new one we are making
 Very nice :)
 yea im likin it
 jaXm, i like the graphics and stuff on the site, but the layout etc... seems a bit messy...:/ and maybe upgrade the stream quality, 96kbps?
 Elliott
 Beta
 JaXm...
 my apologies.
 thats all im gonna say ;)
 i was looking at the old site.
 :)
 oh
 yea
 the v2 is 100% better than the old one:)
 the old one... was made hand in hand with what the "evony admin" told us we had to make it
 still, i'd look into getting a 96kbps stream...:)
 :P
 turns out the "evony admin" was nothing more than a personal assistant to an evony admin
 lol.
 and yes, that stream is small and cheap until we get up and running fully
 thats crap.:P
 ah...ok.:)
 gonna have 320kbps for premium, 128kbps for registered, and 64kbps for unregistered
 i have a station that i dj on, but we're in the middle of a server upgrade...:/
 Connected
 same stats...:P
 Oh JaXm in case you're in need of some way to display your tweets
 but with te new server, its gonna be all at 96 kbps, and 100's of listeners, and optional donations.:)
 we had to restart servers a few times, but current hits for the stream -
 <WEBHITS>303225</WEBHITS>
 <STREAMHITS>14889</STREAMHITS>
 There is a framework somebody here developed for that
 sec
 FREE!:P
 http://lab.lostpixel.net/classes/twitter/
 lol my radio is free as well
 Its pretty sweet, allows you to customize the output via PHP
 nice one, ill keep that handy
 you can thank Tim for that ;)
 i also got approved to do a radio station for Aion
 Aion?
 new game
 Hmm
 is it that beta game?
 Seems they come up every day
 it was in beta yes
 but they launched like... 2 weeks ago or something
 its expected to be as big if not bigger than WoW
 Thats a bit ambitious
 Good thing you have the deal if it happens ;)
 yup =]
 plus im partnered with a site that makes wikis, guides and toolbars for big games
 i got first dips to put my radio on their toolbar, and linked up with their sites
 they just got a deal to make a wiki for the new Command And Conquers
 so once we finish this Evony one, we will do one for Aion and so on
 should make a startup
 startup?
 definately.
 A company
 oh
 to manage them
 i am
 WJXM
 make money...
 :)
 XD
 having the "Mother" site having our sites linked together to it, so from that one site you can read all the news from all the sites, show schedules, make requests, tune in... etc etc
 nice idea.
 wont that mean hosting every site on the same server?
 doesn't have to
 maybe maybe not
 fair.
 you could but you shouldn't, that would add up bandwidth considerably
 i'm sure there's a way around it..
 my current hosting has unlimited bandwidth
 ah. fair.
 but it would slow down your service...
 Dedicated server?
 nope
 *download speeds
 should probably get one
 i would..
 yea will do soon
 1and1 do a good deal..
 :)
 when we start making enough to warrant it
 im with 1and1

 good package...:)
 i design sites, and i normally use the premium package..
 well im off for a bit
 cyas later
 bye
 You lazy bugger TheOracle
 i love that sbot...:p
 if you create a bot, do you have to keep that name signed ino the chatroom at all times for it to work?
 not really, but you should
 a bot isn't helpful when its not online
 thats the problem I had with pyDelphi til I got hosting
 hmmm...
 i created one using a GUI app, but when i quit the app, the bot went offline...:/
 well that means that once you close the frame then it assumes you want to end all of its threads
 :(
 pyDelphi runs on a daemon screen
 i need to make a PHP one really dont i?
 which keeps it alive while I do other stuff in SSH
 and keeps it on when I'm not on :)
 i kinda wanted a bot that stays in the chatroom all the time, like, even when my computer is off.
 then I constructed a manager that checks about every 15 minutes to see if the daemon is still running
 well then you need to have the bot running on another computer :)
 that stays on most of the time
 Here: http://grab.by/8Ml
 pyman is the manager, pyDelphi is the bot
 hmmm. is there any way to host the bot online, or like, have it runing online?
 When I need to force pyDelphi to quit, I just do screen -r pyDelphi
 and then ^C-a\
 which is screen's command to quit
 yes thats what I'm doing
 its running on a server
 ah..
 although the tricky bit is to find a host that actually /allows/ IRC bots
 so, if u turned off your computer, it would still work?
 most don't nowadays
 yes
 cool.
 as long as the server is still online
 who's your host?
 friend of mine

 Seems like the fault is yours then :p
 I only came home cos police think they are bad and can take my alcohol!! T_T
 WOO crazy lesbian chick had to go! YAY PARTY!

 Ben, well, to be fair police get worried when they see a 12 year old with alcohol
 :P
 lol.
 Im not 12 ;)
 Close enough
 ^
 4 years? Nu uh
 leave the alcohol for the old people ben ;)
 No tis mine!!!
 not anymore! HAH!
 lol.
 this is fnny:
 Today, I was at a bar and very drunk. I went to the urinal and when I was done I went to zip up when I realized I never unzipped. FML
 lol.
 bad ben! :O you cant steel drinks from your dad! BAD KID! BAD KID!
 I borrow Dolleh ;)
 suuuuuuuuuuure
 But if you have to, remember what I've said about taking just the good stuff
 they always say that ben!!!
 lol.
 Becks yeh ?
 He lets me Dolleh :D
 wanna hear the top story on fmylife.com?
 Today, I had drunk sex with a girl that I barely know. I didn't have a condom and was nervous about getting her pregnant, but she assured me that I could pull out. Right when I was about to pull out, she wrapped her legs around me and yelled : "BE MY BABY'S DADDY!" I couldn't get out in time. FML
 haa. he deserved it.
 :P
 bad dad! BAD DAD!
 more proof you cant trust dad's
 No Dolleh D=
 I love fmylife.
 Becks is alright, yeah, Ben :p
 Dolleh just doesn't want Ben to have fun D:
 Not what I'd choose, but I'll drink it
 Fosters as well though Alex? ;)
 Ooh what do you have then ?
 lol.
 I like bud
 magners..
 :)
 How about some rea?
 :D
 Fosters isn't a beverage, silly
 *tea
 It's bottled toilet water
 rofl
 ahh my bad ;)
 lol.
 fosters is a bit rough..
 Budweiser is worse
 Look where it comes from, thats why ;)
 tru.
 lol
 LOL.
 LOL
 best by far: OJ...:D
 But then, it's generic American and that's never a good start for a beer.
 :d
 :D
 hahaha
 But then budweiser is again eclipsed in shittiness by the pinnacle of watery shite
 Coors lights
 light*
 :O!
 i went to the coors brewery..
 A mistake?
 what do you have then Alex ?
 By ALEX?!?!?
 its down the road from me...:P
 If you've not considered it, that may be a good reason to move, Elliott ;)
 lol.
 nah, it makes bulmers too....:P
 it makes like, 5 diff beers and ciders.
 Stell FTW!
 wifebeater.
 XD
 Ben: varies, I quite like 1664, kopparberg pear at the moment, peroni nastro azzuro
 ahh nice!
 when i read 'ftw' i hear 'for te h whoo'
 Disaronno is lovely stuff, not beer obviously but neither was kopparberg :p
 anyone here play an instrument?
 (completely off topic...:P
 I used to play the flute and guitar :)
 oh and the triangle
 cool...
 how is babby formed?
 lol.
 i play drums, bass, and guitar..
 :)
 I can play clarinet, saxophone and (very) rudimentary piano.
 i wanna play drums now, but my parents would prbsbaly beat me if i did right now...:P
 lol.
 But haven't touched any of those in over a year and a half
 Elliott still lives in his parents house lol
 im15.
 :P
 I don't play any instruments. That'll be my only contributing remark for a while, thanks. :P
 hmm I used to play piano, recorder and crappy accordeon, didn't do nothing for ages
 lol
 that failed darkkrai.
 I cant fail
 *from now on.
 therefore, you can suck on this
 what? white space?
 lol.
 Suck on this! Tic tacs now only have 1 calories
 wow.
 i did not know that.,
 I should point out, commenting on failure tends not to work too well without a few extra layers of ironic intent
 the chemical symbol for oxygen is O, but it must always be O2, as a single O atom cannot exist.
 :)
 okey doke:)
 *on its own.
 That's not strictly true, they can, they just don't in the prescense of more than one
 presence*
 kinda..
 stop failing me..:P
 ionic bonding ftw
 Because they will always for a diatomic molecule for stability when available
 i know...
 lol.
 i prefer covalent bonding. its easier to understand.
 :)
 Chemistry?!?!
 indeed.
 bye!
 Well good night nobleman Elliott
 Well, in fairness, it wasn't that bad. I just can't remember it.
 Well, we'd already discussed beverages and then music
 It was inevitably going to end up on chemistry
 haha
 i'm not going, i was saying goodbye sbot. stupid computer...:P
 lol.
 well...
 next topic....
 History :)
 %Ben <3 History
 NAZI!
 :)
 A Level History = win!
 nah..
 i'm studying for a diploma in music production...:)
 Yeh.#
 i spend half my days in a recording studio.
 now thats cool.
 FTW!]
 [:)
 but will it get you anywhere ? ;)
 yep.
 once i have the diploma, i have a position as a tracking engneer in a studio...:)
 well... depends if you got skills for it really, even tho you got awesome papers you can still faillllllll
 Hah Alex I did that BTEC in public services in 4 hours, was well easy  :D
 lol..
 I can't say I'm terribly surprised, Ben
 :P
 BTEC courses to tend to be full of fail
 i'm gonna send a link with one of my produced tracks..:)
 do tend*
 lol yeh
 Ben, not studying any of the sciences now is awful though, they're some of the best subjects because they turn into engineering :p
 My course title suggests I'm still doing a science in addition to my actual masters of engineering
 I couldn't abandon them just yet :p
 Sciences give you real fundamental understanding, arts give you waffle, conjecture and 99% inaccurate material :p
 yeh but I prefer my essay subjects over them
 http://www.myspace.com/frankhamiltonband
 listen to waking up @ 3
 :)
 took me 2 days to produce that.:P
 * i dont play anything in the track, i listerally just record it..:)
 *literally
 :)

 We have a maritime climate, so generally the temperature doesn't go far either way
 boohoo damn weather
 this aint no weather for a nigger! GEESH
 We don't get many heat waves, and we don't get much snow... though of course you get years that buck the trends that's climate for you.
 Elliott you liar

 %seen kdigennaro
 Good night Elliott
 Sorry, I haven't seen kdigennaro around.

 :P
 Hah...
 Who is this PHP_student guy on the forums anyway
 http://digg.com/d316msT
 How many inane, vague, broadly-scoped questions has he asked?
 It might be CSS_Guru Alex
 he has been trying to learn PHP lately
 TheOracle: 
 No he isnt
 Cr`eme:
 He asked me to register his channel
 because he doesnt know how
 :P
 And how does that relate to the forums?
 Nothing, thats how.
 Oh..
 Sorry
 My bad
 Could be TheOracle
 I thought yall meant Elliott.
 The questions are certainly dense enough to be Tommy
 Tommy?
 I refuse to call him a Guru even by his nick
 link me to forum post?
 lol
 http://www.zymic.com/forum/index.php?showuser=111978
 Try almost anything in his topic list
 When he calls himself CSS_GURU he says its coutner strike source
 They're mostly stupid questions he could have looked up himself or that are just impossible to fully answer without devoting a book to them because he's so incredibly vague
 He said he doesn't want to read the manual
 sec
 http://grab.by/8Oj
 after that he changes to subject to "how insecure PHP is" :|
 Heh, dear me
 And I assume he said nothing cogent towards that?
 I learned that you need to code it "CORRECTLY" to not hae it "INSECURE".
 I mean, you could argue that the PHP implementation had more vulnerabilities technically and that would be something to do with the language rather than a specific written application
 But if that wasn't what you were arguing, then you've got no chance
 have*
 I didn't say anything after that
 You in a hypothetical person sense, not anyone actually here now
 ?
 Don't worry
 Does anyone believe that he coded that CMS?
 I don't
 well, he probably did
 I can't be sure
 Idk,
 He so called didnt add the register part. Because it wasnt necessary.
 Well
 I haven't seen it, but Ed did
 And he described it as "nice and vulnerable"
 hmm.. I think I have the link
 So, that does suggest he might have written it
 Ed said he used a tut if I recall
 Ah, nice :) http://grab.by/8Oq
 haha i love it when people get angry on cod cos they lose..
 lol
 I love it when I win something, when i'm playing against a male who OBV think he's gona win, but loses, those faces are AWESOME PWND
 huh?
 I cant get on zIRC with xchat on windows
 Nice...

 no spam, just service :D
 someone please kick him out...
 zymic is down alot!
 lol your spaming
 JaXm, please.... kick.:P
 oh, you cant..
 oops.
 so that gives you the right to come onto ZYMIC chatrooms and spam a "service" that might be competing with Zymic?
 Jack
 :)
 dont worry bout it
 lol.
 i meant, jack (nothin) gives him the right.
 :)
 my service just started, it has NO competition!
 ;)
 dont get cocky.
 I have the right to be who I am.

 I bet if you google the source you'll find a identical piece of source ;)
 lol.
 To put it into perspective only a month or so ago Cr`eme asked what 'split' did in python...
 okay...
 what the hel did that mean?
 "LOL"
 ;-)
 thats a bit redundant as well Alex
 what are you guys on about?
 http://osix.net/modules/article/?id=780
 python script..
 Uh-huh.
 So Ed /was/ right?
 well, i havent seen the script cr`eme 'wrote'...
 if i wanted to run that bot script, how would i go about it?
 like, on the zymic server..
 my hosting account.
 You can't.
 ok..
 thought so.
 thats why cr`eme put it on his private server..
 TheOracle: it was either that or I would have to award you the award for expanded RAS syndrome award.
 Take your pick ;)
 what are you guys saying?
 t was a comment on the use of awarding an award award
 That*
 right.
 what do all these awards mean?
 Ah, I'll take the earlier ;-)
 :P
 *essentially, you're dissing me. :P*

 hi
 Anyone active?
 Maaaaybe...
 Hi Robert :P
 http://alexperry.net/blue/blue.jpg hows it look?
 why is there a bar next to twitter?
 beautiful
 TheOracle: idk :P looks
 yeah, that is kindof wierd....
 it doesn't really belong to me
 Can be taken out easily
 and the underline for site map is on hover correct?
 Correct
 looks nice then :)
 im between that design and http://www.alexperry.net/beta/
 you may want to lowercase TOS since everything else is
 yes just noticed that
 hmmm
 I want an android device so bad :(
 Which on DarkKrai?
 mytouch?
 MyTouch looks sweet
 that may be just because Chevy Chase was in the commercial though.
 lol
 lol haha
 cant get a phone for some reason
 verizon's rediculous prices for PDAs/SMartphones
 looking at zii egg
 the palm pre?
 Bah
 That woman is the devil
 OMG
 in the commercial?
 Yes
 she looks fuckin evil
 lol its wrong.
 just wrong
 It comes down to Chevy Chase and The Devil
 I pick the earlier
 idk tho, the pre looks quite awesome
 But its created by Satanists
 so does the mytouch but i prefer a keyboard
 therefore if you use it your head will explode
 lol i hate my phone
 Its beautiful, but has WM 6.5
 WM = terrible
 WM?
 windows mobile
 Nice... haha
 no
 the next iPhone should be run by Apple Mobile :P
 a leo themed UO
 UI :D
 I hope the tablet doesn't run iPhone OS
 That'd be a major turn off for me
 had a tablet been confirmed?
 haha!
 Yes if I recall
 umm, they have patents filed
 but they havent direcley confirmed it
 They have a deal with a distrobutor
 Ah, neat
 im feeling a sneak at macworld in june
 NOOOO D: not the lesbian stalker! OHW HELL
 Anyone mind some shameless self promotion?
 ..
 If you do, I'll take it into consideration.
 And then probably post the link anyhow. :P
 Let's see it

 hey all
 Hola.
 hey kev
 how you doing oracle?
 not too bad ta, working on a front page
 you?
 watching the office lol
 haha <3 that show
 me too :D lol
 is there any resemblence between that kevin and you?
 lol
 thankfully no :P
 guys look at my page :D http://page.netai.net?page=chamillion
 nice
 kdigennaro: favour?
 wat u need?
 logo
 talk in #test
 w00t
 ipod touch 3g jailbreak as been released :D!
 I made a system where yuo can signup and edit/view your very own page
 sounds dangerous
 ?
 If they can edit their own page they can do one or both of the following:
 (or more)
 #1: meta redirect to their own site with a harmful script that attacks user
 #2: javascript that does the same as #1
 I used strip_tags along with aloowed_tags
 #3: inject SQL if it is stored as SQL
 Nullbytes...
 CSS_Guru: that's a very insecure system you have there tbh
 to you everything is insecure...
 you might as well jsut give them your hosting user & pass
 if you're going to give them full access to page create
 you'd want to leave only the basic formatting tags behind
 bbl
 *sigh* Will you do us a favour and stay away a bit longer TheOracle
 If it strips all tags except the basic non-harmful html tags, then how will they do anything having to do with database?
 I don't know off the top of my head
 but i'm sure someone will find a loophole
 exactly
 someone always does
 you can't be totally secure...
 for the most part, my site is secure.... I've done everything I could possibly do lol
 night zymica

 nice

 Cr`eme...:)
 Elliott: ... :)
 where'd sBot go today...?
 :P
 hey... still working on the wiki?
 brb
 Ello mate
 i need to trick out my website.... Hmmm.....
 Trick it out?
 Some marquees, animated gifs and oversized pixel fonts? :p
 lol
 not to the point of annoying
 or... exploding
 <font color="red" size="10000003"><blink>Are you annoyed?</blink></font>
 lol
 and i forgot the <strong> tag
 :P
 P:
 Ed, how would i get the marquee on the left like a sidebar and the text / etc. on the right? ( /index.html )
 I was kidding about the marquee
 instead of just having it above everything?
 I know, i dont care :)
 ;)
 or the text in the center?
 every time i try the <center> tag around the text i want to be centered, it just messes everything up.
 Help :'(
 Ed?
 hey
 Ed: Kubuntu is super amazing.
 Would be nicer if it had a clean KDE4.3.x
 Lots of other distros package a better KDE4 setup
 Kate the text editor is pretty cool too. All the syntax highlighting and formatting for most languages out there.
 Definitely true, I use it
 I was amazed at that. (after Alex vouged for it) :p
 Vouged?
 :P
 :)
 The only thing annoying me about it is the bottom panel
 Nice simple editor, the file listing, split views and console tab make it ideal for quick edits for me.
 Bottom panel of KDE, n33?
 If so you can move that around / alter it how you like
 Plasma is very flexible
 For some reason the text never valign's center.
 What text editor are you using?
 I usually use WeBuilder 2010 om Win.
 Alex: you said it was good for Linux after my rant about my IDE.
 Is it free?
 No.
 Poooooooo
 n33: did you mean vouched then?
 :/ .
 It was just vouged threw me
 Whats the best FREE** text editor?
 Nah. ALEX vouged for it. :P .
 i use notepad2
 some times i use 1st page, lol
 Both useless editors
 1st page, wow, I remember that
 I used to know some of the development team
 **Alex has hookups
 i actually have dreamweaver, but i dont really use it cause it takes sooooooooooo much time to load
 Before it died a horrible stagnating death, and the guy who owned it stop replying to purchase orders
 stopped*
 Makes mr. computer go real slow
 But really, whats the best free editor?
 Kate
 i like notepad2
 Technically cross-platform these days, free open source software
 Not just freeware, proper freedom
 I like notepad2 for the speed, who needs some dreamweaver ($700)
 its to slow
 Dreamweaver is useless.
 No
 messes up code
 it is if it crashes your PC
 Stupid ftp
 yea
 i agree on that
 Adds in code that isn't needed
 Thats why i will always be Notepad2 :D
 'course, it's not just FTP you can save files to using Kate ;)
 You can open any file over any network protocol supported by KDE
 FTP, SFTP, Samba, NFS, etc etc
 **Alex goes on a mission to vouge for Kate again.
 Notepad2 is my forever editor, until i figure out how to work Vim, lol.
 What the hell is "vouge"?
 I swear you've made this word up :p
 Back it
 Vouch is a word
 nope
 Maybe the spelling - not the word :P .
 to "vogue" is a dance
 by uh, kylie minogue
 iirc
 Things "in vogue" are popular
 i Vouch you, you Vouch me, Vouch, the study of Vouch, its 1st grade !
 !google vouge
 n33: the thing was I asked if you meant "vouched" a while ago, and you said "no, you vouged it"
 lol
 none of the bots are here
 So it got even more odd :p
 i Vouched the bots
 its a word that adds some dazzle to your day, you can use it with anything !
 Ah, indeed Alex.
 Just chwcked meaning.
 i have plenty of Vouch to share :d
 :D
 Who said that
 To vouch for something is to endorse it.
 Oh, just those Vouched robots
 Where exactly is this monologue going?
 ...Vouch.....Vouch.....Vouch...
 i need to add some Vouch to my website
 there we go
 I can't wait for that .... Google OS to come out! :D
 does anyone know how to use str_replace in php?
 It doesn't seem to work for me
 Maybe you need to Vouch it?
 vouch?
 Yup... Vouch....
 can someone give an example of str_replace for a large area of text?
 `quit
 will the cron job work
 http://pastesite.com/11009
 CSS_Guru: <CSS_Guru>
 oops
 CSS_Guru: http://pastesite.com/11009
 that a big enough example of str_replace?
 Txstormchasers: he's already gone, but in future, just link him to the php.net documentaion on it
 We're trying to make him read some of it
 For some reason he considers himself above reading them
 Well, i think he should get some Vouch, walmart selling it for $8.00 USD!
 You wondered if you'd gone overboard repeating the same word over and over?
 Well he is a Guru Alex ;)
 OUCH ben you broke my arm D:
 Sorry D:
 ben ben ben, they took mr orange bunny!!
 :O why?
 Heh, bad pun, Ben
 D:
 heh heh
 vouch!
 Vouch!!!!!!
 Okay, Now, im done.
 I hope so, it was boring quite a while ago
 Oh no!
 not the killing bot!
 Yay!
 No more killers!

 Someone can be used collectively in informal English, Ben.  But nice to see you're trying ;)
 thanks dolleh.:)
 T_T

 O_O
 I'm considering Jonathan Coulton when he's over this side of the big pond to the west.
 =_+
 please ban him.
 who ?
 oh its so quiet now
 if you can't talk say something
 hehe sorry alex
 Fright night on wednesday! Whooo!
 whooo
 damn.
 was i banned?
 no
 hmmm..
 No, outlet just put the channel into moderation
 i couldnt send messages to #zymic...:/
 oh.
 :P
 Which meant only voice (+v) and above could talk
 yeah, i realised...:P
 HEY!
 heh when i first came on irc I thought voice was something to do with microphones
 No I am not!
 lol
 microfones!
 Do we need two mutes?
 shure sm57.:)
 yummy.
 :P
 sorry, i'm a geek when it comes to audio stuff.
 :D
 My teacher lost my geography book, all my work this year (lots of pages) gone D:
 that sucks.
 at my school, we can do it all on the computer, and e-mail it...:P
 yeh thats good to an extent.
 yeah, til the servers go down...:P
 but theres a backup server, and battery power for the school to last 1 hour...:)
 still fucked if server breaks.:P
 Well, you'd assume they have a decent backup policy
 yeah.
 The worst thing that could happen is not the servers breaking, it's data corruption that is then copied onto the backup server
 Because then they'd have to go to a stored backup
 haha, well my book had work in fro when we did field work.
 well, yeah, everyday they backup the main files to a 10tb sentry safe.
 fair..
 :)
 hey
 hey
 get in contact with andrew?
 yeah
 he said he'd transfer it to its final home tonight :P
 Where is Andrew ?
 he's been busy
 he's got a 'girlfriend'
 too busy D:
 www.sharpielovers.com/images/grabs/Dsem6.png
 and my response :P www.sharpielovers.com/images/grabs/1Wins.png
 for you ben ^
 What's up with screenshots of text that you could copy paste into here
 hahah thanks Kevin, now what did the rest of it say? xD
 too many lines maybe ?
 its more than 3 lines alex and didnt want to paste site :P
 Last one was about one line :p
 haha it just talked about the transfer :P
 haha that's true
 ah thats good
 now i have to design a website around the phrase 'ghost of the day'
 is there a way with jquery to resize images? so if you want to have a graphic bg or something you can resize for different size reso
 Yes?
 any one have a link to the method?
 Find the resolution of the screen, change document.image.height ect
 ah
 sounds easy enough
 where is Brandon these days ?
 iono
 maybe he got a girl friend too?
 they grow up so fast :P
 thats why I'm not here as much
 nah brandons more of the "bang and boot" type of guy
 He was on earlier Ben
 Left at 15:00
 outlet you dont have to lie to fit in :)
 haha true story ben
 *15:06
 thanks Robert
 Oh no...
 lol its true
 lol i know just playing :P
 I would show you a pic but your all pervs
 ^
 im not
 lmao
 unless its nsfw ;)
 yeah but if I send it to just one of you everyone will get it so.. I'm good with not sharing
 if it is, join #nsfn
 why elliott?
 d.w
 :P
 i thught the link was nsfn.
 what link I'm not posting anything
 ok.
 I would if I wasn't in a room filled with pervs
 this website is going to kill me.... i have so many layouts for it and i dont like any of them...
 would it be lame to use the album art as the website bg?
 show us some ?
 kk sec
 i think i only have the line drawings of it
 kdigennaro No, why would it?
 It's something common to your band
 true
 just dont want to repeat the same stuff to much
 You could even run an update, just before you release a new one, update your site to get people interested in it
 thats true
 here's part of it www.sharpielovers.com/images/grabs/vsAQ7.png looking for the other part its much better
 Could select any album and the website would theme to match
 kdigennaro That'd be fine to put text over - I don't think that would swamp the text
 heres the left half, www.sharpielovers.com/images/grabs/9zZE8.png
 Very different styles...
 But same applies
 kk
 Personally I prefer the first, it flows more...
 ill play with it
 I would do both, but either will do
 yeah theres another half to that second one robert
 wouldn't* do both
 was trying to find it
 im really good at loosing important files lol, i had the whole thing vectored
 its some where on my pc lol
 ah..  that makes sense... its in the album art folder.. lol
 you ever gonna finish sharpielovers?
 not until i finish nascentdescent lol
 which is never
 im hoping its soon.. lol
 you've had 40050345 different designs for it
 yup
 none of them i have liked lol
 gona play with these drawings and see wat i can do
 did brandon ever finish that one
 no
 i did
 link?
 www.sharpielovers.com/images/grabs/8osXK.png
 but i changed it
 its coded somewhere on my server
 the nav i moved under the header image
 and did the content different just didnt change psd
 how do you make photoshop not edit the size of something when you paste it in?
 I didn't know it did that
 omg this is retarted... i can never use ai and ps together because i cant copy and paste over..
 it only does it when i copy a vector from ai
 into ps
 i guess i could probably export but theres no reason copying shouldnt work
 yeah I always hated hat
 that*
 its stupid
 and photoshop sucks anyways
 the gradients are always shit when you overlay them
 i contacted adobe about it and they gave me a link to a pdf that had over 500 solutions that might fix the problem and they told me to try them all
 lol
 would have taken me a month of non stop going at it
 nn

 Gosh I hate python developers
 They are so tricky to talk with
 good product though ;)
 sroracle?
 Brandon: it appears that Python is no longer picking up /dev/urandom
 Which is causing python to crash on-start
 Why are you telling me? Why would I remove something though? :S
 I dunno
 The devs keep telling me to talk with you
 Although it appears to be /their/ problem
 "[19:45:36] <bob2> [[sroracle]]: someone smashed your python install by the looks of it"
 I hope you understand I' not blaming you
 its obvious that something is just wrong with the install
 Biscuit crumbs in the motherboard
 I had a sand one today, Ed :p
 Evening Dave.
 Brandon, beach? :P
 Yep
 nevermind I got the new install going
 bbl
 You mean we have to have you back sroracle?
 Hello.
 The best one that has been in the bloke threatened to take it to court x'D
 Does anyone here know how to get started on registering a simple domain to a hosting account?
 As lame as it may sound, I can't find my way around.
 He said his laptop caught fire so he threw it out the window and it went in to his pond
 Or does this site even offer free web-hosting?
 Mario, http://zymic.com/zcp you can create a hosting account there.
 Haha Brandon, sounds like homework level excuse
 :P
 By a 30+ year old man.
 I found it amusing, he expected to get a new one under warranty.
 Hey there, Ed.
 Oh.. So we may not use our own domains?
 You can use your own domain with the hosting, Mario 
 Where?
 I need to find a pic for my Ipods background
 anyone got any ideas ?
 480x320 in size
 what the tdick
 my ipod jsut shrank from 8gb to ~3
 Mario, just create a subdomain, then you can apply your domain to that
 fuck sake
 my apps wont start :)
 :(
 Bye
 You're a sloth Brandon, sleep at this time... you should be ashamed!
 thats retarded
 itunes is adding a lot of my songs twice
 for no reason
 it appears to be all the songs that the file name starts with a number
 Hi

 Hi
 According to dictionary.com, today's word of the day is 'pukka'; Hello Perry 
 pukka?
 http://www.reference.com/wordoftheday
 ah
 Hey Ed do you want to set sBot so that it displays "the Word of the Day" when someone signs in?
 It would be pretty cool and unique feature to have
 Indeed
 I think some people would find it annoying
 Definitely wrong person Sazzad, Rob wrote sBot :P
 Got to agree, would cause unnecessary channel noise
 Robert: Maybe have a disable function. Say something like !Disable_word
 I know we have something similar with /notice
 I could do !word optout
 Would be cool, Rober
 t
 Yes it would
 Fine
 What do you guys want?
 Word
 Meanings
 Link to full entry?
 Something like this
 pukka (puhk-uh) - adj - Authentic; genuine - He talks like the quintessential pukka Englishman
 Ed: What are the max_execution, max_execution time per script and upload_max_filesize for any Zymic servers?
 15mb?
 Sazzad|Busy Shortening the quote is hard...
 2mb for upload max, http://phpinfo.zymichost.com Sazzad|Busy 
 Would be much easier to give the meanings, then a link to the page
 Or the origin
 Although I imagine that might be a bit too close to the maximum line size
 I also need to cache the word of the day
 But I can do that
 Sazzad - new format
 lol
 pukka (puhk-uh) - adj - Authentic; genuine - Pukka comes from Hindi pakka, "cooked, ripe," from Sanskrit pakva-, from pacati, "he cooks."
 with a link to http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pukka
 Sounds good Robert 
 Ed/Alex
 Is this OK?
 Or would you prefer I didn't?
 Ed: Do you want to put that link on the Server message when people sign in? Saves a lot of time and effort on our part. Or maybe a page that contains link to all these sort of information
 Sazzad - what?
 Robert: Looks good. Go with the short def and then the link
 Is VNDV down still?
 A link to the word of the day? :/
 Oh, phpinfo
 Check #hosting
 Can do, but we rarely get asked

 hi
 hello
 how i can to uplode site in ftp zymic
 ?
 Hmm
 Does anyone know how to create a prompt box with two input lines?
 what do you mean LancerB1?
 Like having one line for a person to input a user name and another line to input a password.
 on a website?
 yes
 http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp
 read the second part, about input
 It isn't a form that I'm trying to create, but does bring some good ideas. 
 I'm tring to make it on Javascript.
 <input type="password" />
 that's how to make a text box that has the characters blocked out
 because it's a password field
 you do the same for a non-password field just replace "password" with "text"
 Yeah, but I'll still need Javascript to verify the password which I have no knowledge up to now.
 put them inside form tags
 and read this....
 http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_eventattributes.asp
 you'll want to look at the Form element events
 Yes, I do know the form elements, well the majority of them, but I just need to figure out how to have a prompt box with 2 input fields.
 Or more if possible.
 wait, like an alert box with with 2 input boxes?
 a prompt box with 2 input boxes like this one
 oh sorry, I misunderstood you then
 http://i278.photobucket.com/albums/kk116/TH3_1R0NWALL/authenticationbox.png
 its ok, I want to try to get something similar to that
 you can do that with the HTACCESS file
 Ok, but for now I want to make it in Javascript and then I'll go to HTACCESS file.
 javascript would be very insecure as you would have to store the password in a javascript file/the page source
 and what if a user had javascript disabled
 I want to know how to do it in Javascript because again I saw that it was done in javascript.
 I'll have separate pages for each script 
 That's also the problem that I'm going to fix when I have javascript disabled on my browser.
 <noscript>stuff here</noscript>
 if a user has javascript disabled, stuff inside the noscript tags is shown
 oh, alright thanks for that tag
 I'm out for today...Bye
 Bye sBot
 You have failed me sBot
 oh well.

 Night #zymic
 Well good night nobleman Ed
 Oh... not sure
 nn ed
 nn Ed
 I think you fucked up something else tbh
 my internet sucks
 all i did was add the domain
 and redirected it to that folder
 nn Ed
 then i deleted the redirect
 to public_html/clients/MMS_WP ?
 because the site went to a 404
 no its public_html/DiGennaroDesigns/clients/MMS_WP
 Uh-huh
 Yea I'm not really sure
 shit i atleast need to fix wat i fucked
 but dono wat i did
 If you pointed the addon to that then it should've worked
 it didnt it fucked the thing up
 It couldn'tve
 well it did
 somehow
 Addon domains don't affect the server drive directories
 i no
 but i didnt do anything to the site
 havent touched it since before this morning
 and it was working fine 5 mins ago
 Then unfortunately that means that it could be a possible drive failure
 But I am not sure
 you mean the server itsself?
 Yes
 Contact LunarPages
 ya shit
 something bad happened
 Brandon: Something's wrong with cPanel
 my site redirects to thers
 http://grab.by/9Cv
 my domain doesnt even exist anymore
 Jesus
 No shit, TheOracle.
 Are you sure it didn't expire kev?
 yup
 nascentdescent.com works

 Damn, I hate eating something without releasing I did, so when I go to look for it it's like :(
 nope didnt remove any domain
 Resizing
 not even the addon kev?
 if not then its the server's fault
 nope
 didnt do anything
 is digennarodesigns.com still on your domain list when you login via nascentdescent.com ?

 sec want to find out wat happened
 I fucked beyonce last night :)
 !sbot bob
 !sbot seen fireworks

 my shit is fucked.......
 what happened?
 did you figure it out?
 Kdigennaro: Who has been putting there thing in to your butt hole to fuck your 'shit'
 the dude doesnt know hes trying to fix it
 he said something went wacky
 hes been trying to fix it for like ten mins
 he said he cant fix it...
 fuck this shit
 now i have he had to fill out a support ticket and now i have to wait
 my client is going to be pissed because i redirected her domain already
 trying to redirect it back but its taking forever
 some how i now have two public_html's in my folder so this dude fucked it up even more..
 "now i have he had to fill out a support ticket and now i have to wait" < Makes no sense.
 Well, it does but the first bit doesn't >.<
 sorry mad and not thinking clearly
 Heh :)
 Think happy thoughts and be calm.
 you think there 'support team' could fix this... i guess they have a 'special support team' or something for problems the support team cant fix lol

 When a laptop has 1.73 GHz clockspeed but 3.06 GHz with Turboboost
 what does that mean?
 means it is overclocked
 Alright, i saw the 1.73 GHz and knew that was bad
 but then saw the 3.06 GHz and got confused
 the standard stable clockspeed is 1.73, overclocking makes it less stable but faster
 Cool. Thanks
 usually if they name it something (like turboboost) and it comes like that from the OEM, then they found a higher clockspeed that is very stable.
 but it makes it get MUCH hotter
 yes
 and for a laptop, it will use more power
 well for anything it uses more power, but with a laptop power mattes

 While working at a pizza parlour I observed a man ordering a small pizza to go. He appeared to be alone and the cook asked him if he would like it cut into 4 pieces or 6. He thought about it for some time before responding. 'Just cut it into 4 pieces; I don't think I'm hungry enough to eat 6 pieces.'

 does anyone know how mobile phones actually work? like when texting
 how does the "signal" know where to go to find the right phone ?
 im not sure but im sure theres something online 
 I wouldn't have thought the ariels just sent out waves until the right phone was found, because surely someone could hack it read every text sent
 id imagine its simular to how a remote works for a tv or a remote controled car
 well there are ways to do that pie
 there are devices that intercept incoming cell signals
 but you have to be close to the person with the phone
 reading this article
 im guessing once a phone sends a text message it's send to the core network, which assigns the 2 phones their own channel frequenicies through which the messages are transmitted
 Hello anyone in here good at making sprites?
 damn mom
 mom killed the laptop ;_; FMLLLLLL
 bad mom :(
 yes D:
 ben fix it kay?
 whats wrong with it ? D:
 I unno
 she killed it
 does it turn on ?
 was messing on the internet with her crap, then it shut down in one sec, now each time you turn it on it shuts down again
 ya but shuts down again >_>
 does it boot into windows ?
 ya
 virus maybe ?
 yeah think so
 my family + internet = BOOM
 Pie`: does the SMS system not have a central push-to repository
 i dunno
 that's why I asked
 So the communication is phone1 -> network, network -> phone2
 No direct phone communication
 At least that was my impression
 Dolleh reformat :D
 D:
 how lolz XD
 I iz not nerd ben
 urgh I need arjan
 hehe you are Dolleh D:
 imma haunt arjan again, urgh need his phonenumber
 lies ben
 Dolleh: Run virus scan :D
 I gave up for today D:
 ed you scared ben! ;_;
 Actually, I switched off his compiter :)
 compiter?
 is that some sort of compiled computer ?
 evil one!
 There are computers that don't run on compiled code these days?
 I thought we'd moved on from programming via switches :p
 Time to put myself to sleep :P
 Night #zymic
 Great, now you're going to leave me with this bunch of degenerates Ed... thanks... thanks ALOT!
 wow :O he goes off to bed EARLIER THEN ME :O
 HOMG
 HOMG!
 be scared ben D: be scared much more!!!
 Hi, wanted to know if you have a limit for how many visits /hits i can have with the free hosting
 Tip44
 has gone :/
 he got scared too probs...
 Dam that Ed T_T
 indeed
 back
 Should watch it Alex ;)
 That's ok :p
 I'm going to watch Nick Griffin get jeered at in Question Time
 YES!!
 Can't wait for that!
 But apart from that I think the less BNP I see the better
 we were talking about it in History today XD
 what day is it on ?
 They're on thursdays
 So it's next thursday, 22nd
 10:35 I believe
 safe
 :)
 Yep should be home by then thanks :)
 Today is going to be a great TV night
 The Office, 30 Rock, Fantasy Factory, Community, Parks & Rec.
 not to mention Attack of the Show as well
 :O who did that
 The Office?  What series?  Or is this one of the spin-off Offices
 The American "The Office", Alex
 Certainly aren't any new episodes of the real Office :p
 Being an American I cannot stand the original ;-)
 You what?  But that one's actually funny!
 Although Ricky Gervais is one of my favourite actors
 My step mum works in the office where The Office was filmed
 well the outside of it irrc
 The characters are just so much more developed in the original
 Better interaction, better acting ;)
 More funnies
 Alex, I cannot argue since I don't know much about British Humour
 All I know is our port is funny as hell
 To /us/
 British humour is fairly cerebral, the humour is derived by circumstances, insight, references to known common social norms
 Not punchlines
 where is that slut ed?
 At least... good British comedy is
 Trice: at 23:22
 <Ed>Time to put myself to sleep :P
 Ah, well, see, to us thats not :p
 <Ed>Night #zymic
 Punchlines can be funny certainly
 ahh yeah playing tennis with ed at 2pm tomo lol
 haha he any good ?
 we end up being geeky and talking while knocking the ball to eachother.
 But a well developed situation (the essence of a TRUE sitcom in my view) with several different reasons to laugh at any point
 apparently he used to play alot tho
 Just so much more to it
 Ah
 ahh nice
 alex you ever tried coding for symbian?
 or wm phones?
 And that's why a lot of you lot over the pond envy our sense of humour, TheOracle ;)
 Tricee: no, I don't have either of those platforms :p
 that welsh bloke makes me laugh but i cant remember his name
 I have worked with Qt in general
 ahh ok alex. Im having issues configuring the sdk
 Alex: Well, I do enjoy the Mighty Boosh if you've ever heard of it
 Mighty Boosh passes me by completely
 There's about two funny parts per episode
 rhod guilbert is the welsh comedian
 And the rest is just peculiar heaped on peculiar
 lee evans too
 but Alex: you're too old to watch the mighty boosh
 that's why you don't think it's funny.
 new nevermind the buzzcocks tho
 Yeah, I'm not really liking that too much this series
 only saw the first episode.
 But well, the only person I like most episodes is Phil Jupitus
 Alex: you don't think the mighty boosh is funny because you're too old to understand it ;)
 i want old buzcocks back, with BB!!
 alex is young
 Yeah, I still think the glory days were Phil, Bill, and Mark
 James Corden just isn't funny by himself - so he was a sucky host.
 Mark lemar wasnt it?
 Lamarr
 Yes
 Never mind the buzcockz is quality!
 thats it
 has anyone ever seen horne & corden ?
 That was awful, Pie`
 it's a complete rip off of peep show
 Utterly awful
 and not a good one at that
 What?  No it isn't :p
 Peep Show isn't like Horne and Corden
 wait not peep show
 but it was the 2 guys who did peep show
 who did something similar
 peep show bored me a bit
 peep show was awesome :D
 alex wana come play tennis tomo?
 I know what show you mean, Pie` but I still don't really see it
 The similarity is that they're both sketch shows
 But that format was established before both of those shows
 The difference really, is that Mitchell and Webb are funny
 And Corden's only decent work is Gavin & Stacey
 And from the rest of his stuff, I'm sure that's just because he was only co-writing
 I bet he'd have messed it up if he'd done it himself
 Gavin and stacey  was alright
 got old pretty fast though
 Tricee: sure, if I can pick the location
 did you know Medomalacuphobia is the fear of loosing an erection
 nope tis in essex me ol boy. At my work.
 Alright new deal, you buy me the return ticket on the train :p
 um no thats expensive
 im providing the venue
 Just what I was thinking
 a david lloyds gym with 12 tennis courts
 There's a sports centre at uni you know :p
 lol
 yeah but ours is better
 Oh aye?  Come over here and look before you say that ;)
 i dont want to
 lol
 http://innovay.com/ Load?
 :p
 yes
 Well it shows a little orange swoosh and thats about it
 Anyway, got sidetracked ;)
 The new line ups for nevermind are disappointing to say the least :p
 This last episode that just aired is the first one where Noel Fielding hasn't annoyed me
 And the hosts, apart from episode two where you had banter between Rhod Gilbert and Phil's team
 is he like that bloke with long hair?
 He's the new team captain
 BB's replacement
 As if he could ever manage that one
 BB is by far the best comedian alive(IMO)
 The hosts have mostly been useless though, there's none of the Buzzcocks' normal complete disdain for the guests or the insulting jokes about pop culture
 And that's what I watched it for, and why Mark Lamarr was the best host they had :p
 Though Simon Amstell did manage a passable performance
 After he stopped trying to be Mark Lamarr, so aftter his first series
 When Mark Lamarr made a joke about having waiting for hours to get a decent shot at a member of Blue with a sniper rifle
 You believed him ;)
 waited*
 When I saw Bill Bailey a few months back he mentioned Buzzcocks
 Said the reason he doesn't do it any more was because he couldn't stand humming an intro to one more indie know-nothing :p
 well night night zymics
 ben... you the new ed!!!
 i should not be awake at this time
 indeed pie, go away
 and if i were, i should be doing the homework thats due in in like, 5 hours

 Having a break Ben? Don't forget your kit kat
 hello steve, im not having hosting problems yet, i am having trouble logging into my account
 i reset my password a few times and i get a message that says i need to activate my account which i think i did a while back when i registered
 i have never even set up a website yet and when i tried to do so today i could not get logged in 
 how do i go about finding my activation code?
 is there a way i can re register my username agine?
 i sent an e-mail to the administration and they sent me back a link to come here, or is this a hosting problem? 
 metalmaster1766: Steve is a bot, and you should follow his advice
 i was in the hosting chat before i e-mailed the admin and someone there said to e-mail the admin about it which i did
 im not real sure what a bot is
 i just want to setup my account and begin a website 
 A computer program that responds to certain events in IRC with programmed responses
 In this case, it notifies new users that this channel is not for hosting support
 Alex: what about a markov chain bot, that's not really a programmed respone ;)
 It is, it's still deterministic
 its not been told what to say, its just been told how to go about doing it
 It's been told how to reach a response, and its reponses can be determined via the current state of the computer and the data associated with the bot
 The only true randomness is in the data it has gathered by being in the channel, but the responses have a known set of data each time
 so am i in the right place to take care of my account problem?
 The right place is #hosting
 #zymic is the wrong place
 and if so can some one please help me
 This is #zymic ;)
 Alex: he said he already went to #hosting, and did as he was told
 ok  thank you very much,  i will go back there and try again, i was there before and no one responded to me at all
 and I guess he hasnt got a reply back
 I know, but someone not responding in the correct channel isn't reason to ask in a channel where it's off-topic
 So it's informative to let people know this channel is not for hosting queries
 thanks again, i will just go back and ask again and wait
 Herro #zymic!

 Alex: is that guy getting on your nerves yet?

 he wants something done, but he only wants it done the way that he thinks is perfect
 and is basically refusing to listen to anyone else
 logs
 logs are too long for me to be bothered to pastie
 but if you just join and listne
 I'm hoping if I go through this slowly, I can do things one at a time
 And maybe we'll eventually get to an amicable solution
 MrDecay?
 Please don't add any more confusion, DarkKrai
 In fact, no one else talk unless I give up :p
 DarkKrai: yes

 5. Switch to Linux-powered Computers
 Did you know that Linux computers can save e-waste levels by 50%? There was a study done in 2004 that reported definite green benefits to running Linux-powered computers. The main reason: Windows systems had to change hardware every 3-4 years, where Linux systems only needed hardware refreshes every 6-8 years. (source)
 While the study is five years old (an eternity in technology years), it still leaves something to consider the next time you purchase a computer.

 I wish I was a rapper. There are certainly times when I wish I could just drop an album and channel all my ideas, anger, humor and energy into some music and be done with it.
 Is rap the only medium capable of this?
 How did they manage to get people to believe that
 :P
 I am doing a new site.
 This one is annoying me
 [00:32:13] <%Dolleh> why does evony has anoyying ads with halfnaked ladies, ITS ANOYYING T_T
 Dolleh: it's called marketing
 nerds are generally male
 nerds like boobs
 boobs = money
 Nerds like boobs?

 I'm sure every male enjoys an eye full of breasts ;)

 I'M DYING
 what does he want from you?
 omg D: 'are you coming to look at the livingroom?'  
 ahw my gawd I must be dying
 I have no idea rebel, but it CANT be good ;_;
 maybe poison in my tea?

 maybe... its Ben!

 Drag & drop is sweet http://grab.by/aiL
 It considers that py file binary?  Is it compiled?
 Though I suppose that's being somewhat picky ;)
 Its not compiled no
 But I kinda expected it to be intelligent to preview the contents of a text file
 It just doesn't recognize python files
 intelligent enough*
 The file is intact, its just that they haven't set up a system for non-pic file descriptors yet
 It's not difficult to determine that the file is a text file and not binary though
 what's that TheOracle ?
 Like I said, it's quite picky
 wave?
 I just expected it
 I'm sure they'll add that later
 They have other things to focus on right now
 Have they got something in there to get all your data off of the cloud?
 Mainly, letting me know who's online
 Not sure
 Because that's a fundamental thing for me :p
 If it doesn't have that, it's not ready for use imo
 But Google are typically not that bad for this sort of thing
 They have a "data freedom" group
 The other thing, since it's intended as a replacement for sendmail
 Yea well
 I'm just dazzled about adding a picture by dragging it ;-)
 http://grab.by/aiQ
 Is I wonder how they've approached the issue of authentication, identification and spam
 I just had to drag it, then I could add the description...
 It uploads in-line
 very nifty
 Because that's a major problem with sendmail, and it would be a real reason to switch to wave
 If it fixes that, there will be adoption
 If it doesn't, then most people will just keep on using email :p
 For some time
 Hi, why is my site shown as a "red" web of trust rating? Even though I made it two mins ago?
 It's possible whatever trust service you're using doesn't take subdomains into account
 And instead considers the domain and all of its subdomains as a whole
 In which case, one bad site found anywhere on the domain would reflect badly on all subdomains
 An unfortunate but unavoidable by-product of free hosting.
 What is it that's providing your "web of trust rating"?
 We might be able to use it to remove any offending sites it has found
 And hopefully clear it up
 google -> mywot
 Ah, I see, it's user-generated reviews
 What's your site URL?  I'll check up on what's said about us
 www.airmilano.zymichost.com
 Yeah, we've got two bad reviews for spam sites on that domain
 They both look fairly automated, and they don't specify which URLs they flagged
 Ok
 I might pass along wot to the hosting support folk, we already check up on Norton's internet safety database and try to keep that clean
 Thank you for your help :)
 Grazie, much appreciated
 TheOracle, is that google wave?
 Yes
 wha?
 you got an invite?
 :(
 Yea from some guy on Freenode
 Or maybe not from there
 Not sure, came randomly in my Inbox
 I don't recognize the username
 what is the process to enable mail function of php???
 can somebody plz tell me
 ??
 anybody there for help???
 can you invite me?
 imranzahoor: you should be in #hosting, it's a $10 USD one-time payment, and you could at least wait a few minutes before getting impatient with us
 hello
 yes I am ready to pay $10 but how can I pay
 Evening
 ???
 I am in Pakistan
 and I am unable to get access to paypal
 so its problem for me
 Meeso: No, the invites do not recurse into the invited.
 but I need to enable mail function of php@@@alex
 Therefore I don't have any invites to give
 I'm not sure what the payment options are to be honest, because this isn't the hosting support room and I don't deal with it
 Night.
 Great, now you're going to leave me with this bunch of degenerates rebel... thanks... thanks ALOT!
 You should ask in #hosting imranzahoor
 i am not sure but wouldnt this be better asked in #hosting
 Heh, perceptive, Drazilaustin ;)
 lol i wasnt even looking at your comment
 i was looking at the keybord
 so i didnt see that you already said it
 Oh dear, what kind of self-respecting IRC user looks at the keyboard while they type!
 me
 Not really
 rofl
 I glance at the keyboard once then look back at the screen
 hmm
 my poor keyboard, its pretty, I never look at it :(
 Provided I don't think about where any of the letters are, then I know without looking ;)
 it is just not as easy for me to memorize
 If you actually made me think about it, I probably wouldn't get half of them
 I just need to get situated before I type ;-)
 But my subconscious knows
 but thats cause i dont type correctly
 Then its a breeze
 i do the 1 button at a time
 TheOracle: just get used to putting your hands in the touch-typing positions
 I do Alex
 Don't have to actually touch-type
 But that way you know where you are without looking :p
 I just like to double-check
 i dont have my fingers over the correct keys i just hover ofer them when i need them
 Fair enough I suppose, most people start that way, but it is a lot easier if you get used to having your fingers in the same place each time
 i am currently working on a new page with my uncle
 Drazilaustin: you sound like me dad
 what do you mean
 He likes to press each key one at a type, and he /pounds/ them.
 time*
 lol
 well i am working on a family site with my uncle
 You might consider learning touch-typing, you don't have to get it down perfectly, and you can stop following it, I for example don't keep my hands in the same place like touch-typing says you should
 But I did learn a bit of touch-typing back in school, and it helps even if you later decide you can't be assed with it :p
 (on his account)
 it is pritty much done
 My parents are probably better typists than me, but well... what do you expect when one of them is a Chartered Software Engineer ;)
 yeah
 Gives them an unfair advantage really
 well i used to be slow
 i started out going where is the t where is the t. there it is now where is the h.
 now i dont even have to think about it
 unless i am checking me spelling while i type the word
 i found some weird things on a few of the domains
 Weird things?
 like on zymichost.com and zxq.net (only ones i have checked)
 if a variable is not set then when you use it in an if statement it displays a message saying the variable is not set
 (in php)
 A notice
 on vndv this works just fine if statment works fine.     if ($acp['site']=="off" && $_SESSION['rank']!="admin") {
 It's an error level in PHP that is not enabled by default
 wait it didnt copy the whole thing
 They're minor errors, hardly able to be called errors at all
 if ($acp['site']=="off" && $_SESSION['rank']!="admin") { header('Location: http://mazemaker.vndv.com/sitedown.php'); }
 Which provide information that let you write better-formed PHP
 Ah, yeah, header() doesn't work if you have any output to the browser, and the notice will cause that header call to fail
 yea.
 that was the problem
 i had to go in and set the session variable right before this to get it to work
 that header is to redirect you to a spacific page when the site is shut down
 this way only admins may be logged in when the site is down
 so i was wondering how you rank up on the chatrooms
 i have been seeing higher ranks but i never knew how you get them
 Drazilaustin: well, you can either try changing the error reporting level
 E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE
 Is the default that suppresses notices
 Or you can fix the problem causing the notice
 By checking if the variable is set with isset() before using it
 i just went and fixed the problem causing the notice
 yeah thats what i did
 Good, that's the preferred solution
 Anyhoo, rank on chatrooms, you mean the ranks here?  Voice, half-op, op, admin and owner
 i did    if (!isset($_SESSION['rank']))  $_SESSION['rank']="guest";
 and yes
 i was wondering what the requerments are for the ranks
 Well, the pre-requisites vary from IRCd to IRCd
 Here, we give voice to regulars, notable members
 And the later ones to people we want as moderators
 aah
 The more trusted you are as a moderator, the higher you go
 i get it now
 how close do you think i am to ranking up XD.
 Not terribly close, I recognise your nick, but you haven't been around for a goodly while :p
 You'd get voice after participating regularly for some months
 ah that makes sence
 Alex I think I'm deserving half-op, I've been here for a while ;-)
 does codeing skills effect your chances at all
 and i gues spelling
 lol i is bad with spellin and gramor
 Well, it certainly helps in this channel, a fair few of the questions we get here are programming related (also heavily in #php)
 So if you're good at programming you'll find it easier to contribute in this channel
 well i am like almost an expert in php
 And it's contribution that gets you noticed
 but i still need to get down some of the more complicated stuff.
 Hint: never call yourself an expert ;)
 If you're good, then let your experience speak for itself
 thats why i said almost
 If you have to say you're good, then you're not yet :p
 i know i am not the best
 and hey i made a maze maker site from scratch. that has to say something
 I didn't say you said that, but I'm just saying that saying you're very good at something can backfire on people's perceptions
 your right
 For example, I refuse to call Tommy by his nick on IRC which is "CSS_Guru"
 PHP_Guru got a lot of hate for his nick
 Yea
 Yeah, he had that version for a while too
 i het the idea
 get
 not het
 Then he went for PHP_Student on the forums, so maybe he wised up a bit after I mocked him :p
 After everyone mocked him
 Jake beat him up a bit as well
 Well, most people, Ed's generally too polite to say it
 Ed? Polite?
 Unless you manage to annoy him, yes :p
 but although i dont know everything about php i will say i am good enough to make a forum from scratch if i had to
 But maybe I have low standards for suffering fools ;)
 Drazilaustin: good, always nice to know there's more to learn
 It would be boring if you knew it all :p
 i am definetly an expert at the BASICS of php
 but anyone can be an expert at the basics
 it is all the non basics that are most dificult to learn'
 Well, the non-obvious stuff just takes a lot of time really, there's rather a lot of it
 There is no Dana, only Zuul!"
 Still, provided you've got a decent grounding in the fundamentals of computer science, you can quickly pick up any sane language within a few weeks
 well yeah thats what i ment but still it is easy to master the basics because the basics dont take much time to learn
 It's the concepts and not the language itself that's difficult
 yup
 And when I say pick up, I mean a computer science graduate should be able to write production-quality code after a few weeks
 i am at a level of understanding to where i can spot syntax errors in others coding.
 Well I gotta eat
 IMO, there isn't much to PHP
 ok bye
 its mostly just functions
 Alex: please consider my request :-)
 yeah
 Well, that's to be expected
 PHP is a scripting/prototyping language
 but php has a LOT of functions so it pritty much the same as something that has a lot to it
 PHP has some really awesome functions that I wish other languages had
 It's meant to have low barriers to entry
 for example levenshtein()
 whats that do
 calculates the distance between 2 strings
 Drazilaustin: php manual ;)
 ie: the operations needed to convert string 1 into string 2
 levenshtein("llo", "lol")
 will return 1
 interesting
 No it won't
 i am not sure wich functions i like best
 It doesn't include character move operations
 Only remove, replace, delete
 So that takes two operations
 see there is always more to learn
 og
 oh *
 In this case, two replace operations, or a delete and an insert
 i have kinda taken a likeing to the preg functions
 i made a fake of bbcode with them
 They're very powerful
 yes they are
 But sometimes other functions (the standard string ones) are better
 As they're faster
 i also like how easy it is to make strings
 Well, they're always more efficient, but you just can't beat the simplicity of expression regex can provide sometimes
 true
 I don't understand regex much
 It's like how recursion is always less efficient than iteration, and you can always replace it, but some use-cases are just much more easily expressed in recursive form.
 ive had a bash at it a couple of times
 regex looks complicated but really it is just getting the hang of it that is the problem
 but i never did manage to grasp it
 it is not that hard once you understand it
 My uni course introduced it really quite well I thought
 Linked it to finite automata
 pie didnt you sign up for my maze site
 So you could see how to express any given regular expression as a series of logical steps, and how to go the other way as well.
 oh and do you guys want to see the regex i used for making bbcodes'
 Introduced that way largely because it's very visual, and it means you can easily apply some discrete maths to simplify any regular expression.
 here it is     '`\[(.+?)=?(.*?)\](.+?)\[/\1\]`s'
 shouldnt that b
 \\
 otherwise you're escaping the square braces
 unless you want to be doing that ?
 He wants to
 He wants a literal square brace, not a range
 i want to escape the [
 and ]
 because it is looking for stuff like [b]text[/b]
 ah
 fallouts time?
 this way i can replace it with <strong>text</strong>
 would you want <b> </b>
 instead of <strong> ?
 Other way around
 i am intermidiet at useing regexes
 <b> is deprecated, <strong> is recommended
 i am good but i can be a lot better
 oh
 why did they deprecate <b> ? :S
 idk
 Because they decided that single-letter tags wasn't particularly descriptive
 weren't*
 mmk
 true
 Robert: isn't CakePHP some scritp framework
 or something
 HTML is a fairly expressive language, and you get more semantic meaning from <strong> than <b>
 but it is easy to remember b is bold
 i'd rather have <bold> than <strong>
 Pie` Yes
 The idea of picking strong instead of bold
 Robert: what exactly is it for?
 Is that you can redefine the style to be something that isn't bold
 You're saying this is a strongly featured piece of text
 Building sites
 It's got a very good model/relationship system
 That usually means bold, but it could also semantically fit a font size enlargement with font weight normal
 So you've got more semantic flexibility from <strong> than you would from <bold>
 hmm this is getting confueing
 Drazilaustin: Alex likes his big words
 :D
 And that's also the same reason for <em> rather than <italic> or <i>
 Since you're delimiting text that is "emphasised", which might mean it's italic, or something else
 i know
 Basically, <bold> and <italic> would bring style information into HTML
 And the idea is that HTML should only describe content, and the style information should all be in CSS
 i like how you display < and > in html
 Pie`: I do, they're more concise than messing about using four of five simple words to say what I mean :p
 But you often confuse people :D
 &lt; &gt;
 wait
 Only stupid people who don't know how to use a dictionary
 And I'm ok with that
 whos talking about what
 I often don't understand what you say :(
 i think we are on different pages at the moment
 or at least i am
 Pie`: well, if you can't find a suitable definition online, then ask what the word means ;)
 I don't mind explaining
 But I do mind dumbing down my vocabulary just because some people are too lazy to google define:word
 but still maybe you could tone down the big words a bit
 I didn't know you could use define as a keyword in google :D
 but k
 i mean not everyone here is smart :p
 I wanna know who discovered the search keywords for google
 idk
 serch it
 They're covered in google's documentation
 If you want to look up what's available
 i think if anything knows google does
 http://www.google.co.uk/help/features.html
 if not then it can be a veary good serch engin to not have info on itself
 back
 i ment cant
 i am bored.
 I don't understand how my school got IT specialist status...
 Michigan
 Nice
 Why, Pie`?
 the network goes down every other day, its slow as shit, all the computers are > 3 years ol
 you can hide files but not unhide them
 Hahaha
 you can play with display settings
 you can run non-allowed executables from the local drive, but you can from an external drive
 You're allowed to play with display settings.
 you can run batchfiles from inside zip archives
 Just incase if you have eye-sight issues etc..
 But, about the bat files.. fun times x'D.
 if you have eye-sight issues you could turn on high contrast ;)
 Some display settings should not be available :p
 i hate going into phpmyadmin
 Yea, well.
 Bob: alt+shift_print screen
 Like being able to turn the display upside-down
 Yes
 Alex: that's allowed :p
 its even on a shortcut
 Users have no business changing the display orientation
 :P
 Haha
 But yeah, my college even had that one available
 I know some people in school can read the screen because of the colours it has to be in like red or purple or something silly.
 the system admins have tried to 'hide' stuff
 but failed miserably
 My school went through a period where every laptop had the screens messed up because of flipping
 like when you plug a memory stick in
 instead of being in my computer, it creates a new folder on the mapped network drive
 O_o.
 o_O
 that took me all of about 10 minutes to find
 That's odd
 Very odd
 yeah
 but yet, they've disabled the IRC protocol
 Indeed
 or blocked outgoing connections though port 6667
 They tend to block everything :P
 Bob: they failed at that too
 I remember at one point our secondary school decided that it was too dangerous to allow right clicks on the desktop
 i can just host an SSH server form my pc " home
 They did that at our school we flipped :p
 Yeah, they backed down on that one
 then use putty to SOCKS to my home pc
 so wahts your best sites
 hey presto, HTTP proxy
 whats*
 It got really annoying but they gave it back because not many people knew of the keyboard shortcuts ;/
 It was just annoying, because you couldn't get to the menu to safely remove USB devices, because that didn't respond to any clicks at all after they changed that
 There may be a way of getting to it some other way
 The key next to ALT I believe
 But I was never much of a Windows guru, and as it happened none of the IT technicians could come up with an alternate way of getting it either
 php safe mode is enabled. In php official docs they say that it was deprecated. Can't zymic upgrade to a newer php?
 It was deprecated in 5.3.0, will be removed in 6.0.0
 what
 Still, it's not been removed yet, and we'd rather not mess around with the system until we have to, it is required for security at the moment
 safe mode is deprecated? what the hell
 whys that
 We tried a 5.3.0 upgrade on one of the hosting servers
 Had no end of bother, so we rolled it back
 what is php safe mode
 something that restricts php scripts
 Drazilaustin: you reall need to look at the php docs more
 ???
 Pie`: the minutes where they decided to remove it say basically that it doesn't make things significantly safer if the platform is set up right
 In my school the profiles were shocking, it wouldn't use the server to use our profiles it would use the actual desktop itself. So if I set a cool picture for my wallpaper then go on another computer it would be the normal dull blue bg :P Where as in work anywhere you go on the network your profile will come up as it should on any other computer which is what I liked and it wouldn't be slow at logging in as it would be in school.
 Pie`: it gave a false sense of security that it didn't really provide except in some circumstances
 :P
 mmk
 Pie`: so they're removing it to reduce confusion, and so they have less stuff to support in the PHP source tree
 Bob: thats sort of like my school
 my school the user variables are set to one pc
 so when it is removed will i have to do anything to my sites
 ie; desktop background
 browser settings
 actual documents etc are stored on the server
 does safe mode prevents spammers from sending spams or criminals from setting up phishing sites?
 but will i have to do anything to them
 No, safe mode is necessary for us to maintain separation between different accounts on the same shared hosting server
 ahh'
 otehrwise users could access each otehrs documents, Drazilaustin
 Aye, that's a good thing. By my school network is pretty secure :P
 At the moment anyway
 http://uk.php.net/manual/en/features.safe-mode.functions.php
 Drazilaustin ^
 We will need to look into how we're going to work with PHP6 not having it :p
 found a how to use mediawiki upload function in a host with php safe mode enabled
 need to test if the maintence jobs can run under safe mode
 Most popular projects are capable of running fine with safe_mode on, shame that mediawiki has issues
 But well, I wouldn't like to try and alter it to make it safe_mode capable, mediawiki is a huge mess of code :p
 Thats because MediaWiki is developed on systems with root access
 what will you guys do when it is removed
 It wasn't meant to be run on other systems but Wikimedia's at all til somebody released the source
 We've not decided yet, we've still got a fair while before PHP6 adoption becomes important
 ok.
 well thats good
 There's still no date set for a 6.0.0 release
 hi ed
 thats good it means there is a while till you have to do anything
 but this also gives you time to plan out the chainges and test them
 I'm beginning to think that safe mode is better than 1% cpu usage limit, I tried to setup a mediawiki on a free host with 1% cpu usage limit, it did run, but as soon as I tried to import all pages to the database, mediawiki cpu usage went over 1% and the operation failed
 Alex: 5.3.0 only just came out, 6.0.0 is a long way off yet :p
 Pie`: cheers for repeating what I've basically just said ;)
 huray
 shh
 and better than forcing php memory limit to tiny 16m
 *wispers* why
 why did that bold itself
 because generally stuff inside * * is an action :p
 *nudges Drazilaustin*
 ???
 You should use /me instead of ** really
 It harks back to old primitive network protocols
 That didn't have characters for bold
 So if you wanted to bold something you did *bold*
 And the client handled it
 ???
 Google Talk did that for example
 ah
 You also had /italics/ and _underline_
 mirc doesnt
 what else is there
 No, because IRC has de-facto characters for those
 is there a strike
 Not defined in the standard, but they're usually implemented in most IRC clients
 ???
 So IRC doesn't need those
 In most clients
 So most clients don't do it
 I'm just explaining why some clients might choose to do it
 let me try -this-
 nope
 i thought that may do strike
 oh well
 there isn't much use of strikethrough
 therefore I don't know of any clients that use it
 good point
 besides, the hyphen is often used in lines on its own
 so many byethost resellers, they all offer the same plans, same hardware and the same sing up form
 sign up
 maybe --this-- would work
 Alex: how many kb is there in a mb ?
 is it 1024 ?
 If it does work, it'll only be working for you ;)
 Pie`: depends on context
 bytes
 At least going by the IEEE recommendation
 not bits
 i have yet to use up 1 mb on any of my sites
 1024 should be used for cases where there's digital storage involved
 it still says i have used up 0 mb
 So 1MB of storage is 1024kB
 %c 1 MB to KB
 1 MB to KB = 1000
 Odd
 But in things like network traffic, where binary size isn't important
 %c 1 KB to B
 Pie`: Sorry, can't calculate that.
 1MB/s = 1000kB/s
 wow cant do kb to b
 ?
 fail
 i am lost now
 no you have to write bytes
 doesn't recognize B
 It's a weird recommendation
 wow cant do kb to bytes
 But that's what the IEEE says
 woops
 %c 1 KB to Bytes
 Pie`: Sorry, can't calculate that.
 %c 1 KB as bytes
 1 KB as bytes = 1000
 I'm retrying to run mediawiki, uploading again
 aaaaah!!!
 iirc its 1024
 not 1000
 windows uses 1024
 I just said, it depends on context :p
 It uses Frink
 therefore I can't change it
 If you want something that isn't ambiguous, Pie`
 You should use KiB
 my brain is busting up with all these equasions
 %c 1 KiB to Bytes
 MiB, etc
 Pie`: Sorry, can't calculate that.
 i cant even sepll rite
 Those are the binary prefixes, and are /always/ 1024
 But yeah, kB etc in binary storage uses 1024
 kB etc for things like network traffic uses 1000
 It's messed up
 i will come back later when i can understand you guys
 hmm
 Alex: why don't you implement something like GeSHi to pastesite ?
 But they didn't realise how confusing it was going to be when they decided to borrow the SI prefixes :p
 would make it look more attractive imo, I would use it more as well
 Pie`: because I don't like GeSHi
 Alex there's a python alternative
 the default PHP colourings are really ugly >_<
 Sec
 There's an alternate theme in pastesite, Pie`
 You could use that
 Also, if you don't like that either
 Because Text_Highlighter doesn't hard-code the styles
 http://pygments.org/
 You can override the stylesheet if you really want to
 It supports a wide variety of languages
 Far more than is actually generally useful :p
 True
 Pie`: do you not like the alternate highlighting theme on pastesite either?
 The light on dark one
 it fucks with my eyes O_o
 Heh
 The idea is that you get more contrast, and it's /easier/ on the eyes
 At least that's why a lot of programmers prefer to work in a light on dark theme
 could you add GeSHi just for me? :p
 or Pygments
 No, I really don't like the outputs GeSHi provides :p
 you dont have to view them ;)
 Very nasty
 In terms of making the code half-way sane
 net2ftp is taking so long to decompress a 3,5mb zip
 Alex - switchTheme() doesn't work on chrome
 I'm not getting any errors in the developer console
 But nothing is happening
 Robert it works for me
 You're on a page which shows some code, right?
 Just making sure
 Because it only changes the highlighting theme
 If there's no code, you'll see nowt
 Ah, OK
 I thought it did the entire site in some way
 I wondered about that
 Maybe just adding some sort of tag that said "Alt theme"
 So it was a bit more obvious
 Alex: maybe you could add in some serious themes
 and have a dorp down menu
 But well, I never planned on themeing the whole site
 to select one
 drop *
 Also possible
 I have to say, for something you wrote in a day, it's been used by a huge number of people!
 and a way to say your favourite theme -.-
 About 4,000 a year, 10 a day :p
 Pie`: write me a load of highlight CSS files
 And I might put them in ;)
 I'm no whizz when it comes to pretty HTML themes
 The highlight styles are in separate
 files
 You don't need to touch the rest of the site
 I can try and make one
 still decompressing the zip???
 I just need a list of the classes
 http://pastesite.com/highlight.css http://pastesite.com/alt-highlight.css
 There aren't many
 Alright
 Robert: yeah, it's not done too badly considering the complete lack of any marketing :p
 It's all organic really
 Jesus I'm tried
 nevermind
 tired*
 And as far as I know I rank top for most people in google for "pastesite" and "paste site"
 Though I have to admit a large proportion of my google traffic comes from random keywords in odd paste contents
 Oh, and 16.12% of my traffic is referred from pornbb.org
 The depressing thing, that figure has actually gone down, it used to be worse ;)
 Hah
 People posting list of rapidshare etc links
 lists*
 :(
 mediawiki doesn't work

 is it odd that im 16 and I still have some of my baby teeth ?
 yes
 although I'm 17 and I have fucked up teeth with braces... so, no. ;-)
 heh
 ive onyl lost 1 of my molars
 rest of my molars are still baby
 but the rest of my teeth are adult
 Maybe your parents lied, and you're actually 12
 It could happen
 It is rather unusual I think :p
 "The process of shedding deciduous teeth and the replacement by permanent teeth is called exfoliation. This may last from age six to age twelve. By age twelve there usually are only permanent teeth remaining."

 Yep.    Mostly from no one being around to answer questions.  Hahahaha
 Are you trying to upload your entire website and setup?

 I am not really sure how to go about fixing that.

 bleh
 what are you doing JaXm?
 working on my website
 got a link?
 http://evonyradio.com
 nice, your design?
 not *mine* but my web developers yes
 looks great
 yea its nice
 im working on http://evonyradio.com/forums.php
 any suggestions to implement the forums in there wiuthout navving to a new page?
 what do you mean?
 like right now it looks squished in there
 should i maybe remove the right nav and widen it?
 you should just skin the forum
 iframes arent very nice, imo
 skin the forum to make it look just like the website?
 Yes
 hmmm
 That's how it is usually done
 Websites are designed, followed by the forum to match the main design.
 I would say put the forum in forum/ and theme it :p
 Whoops, didn't read timestamps, this is kinda late ;)
 lol no worries
 Still, definitely just get your web designer to do a mockup, and try to get a list of all the elements that have to be themed, though you can do it piece by piece if you want
 It's not uncommon to forget to theme one button image or something :p
 zv5 forums had a blue button for about a year before someone could be bothered to make it green
 lol
 Thanks for the help yesterday Alex. I finally understand how mod_rewrite works and how to use it :P

 she thought I was emo... lol

 I need help
 I'm afraid we need a little more than that Saazad :p
 And anyway, we already know, and there's not a lot we can do about *those* problems...
 Lol
 I need to design a nightclub/dance club logo
 I need some suggestion
 %Dolleh (Dolleh@face.in.a.bowl.of.saimin) Quit (Quit: *yawns* <insert awesome quitmessage of doom here>)
 Is it a short name?
 Most of the clubs around here either go for the first letter glammed up or the name in similar fashion
 Sorry for the delay. Was googling things
 The name of the club is "Freedom Station"
 thats wierd JaXm :S It goes and comes
 the simpleXML errors
 hooray for boobies?
 haha
 hello.
 does anyone know any other free webhosting sites.
 well
 seems how this is a free webhosting service...
 it would be immoral of us to advertise other free webhosting services here
 i kinda want to try to make a proxy but i dont want to break any rules
 i would suggest you go to www.google.com
 do they do hosting.
 its a search engine
 ...... ok.
 do you think they will have rules against proxys
 go search for it
 ok. give me a min.
 hahahah
 ok it doesnt look like its free -__-
 what website are you looking at right now?
 wait.
 nvm wrong site.
 but i have yet to find any free web hosts.
 i was actualy told about this one
  i didnt find it.
 http://www.free-webhosts.com/
 google works wonders ;)
 i dont think any free web hosting places will allow you to host a proxy site
 most likely not
 even alot of paid hosts dont allow it.
 hmm. oh well. if you find a site that will do it let me know.
 THESE FUCKERS ARE IDIOTS
 uh..........................
 agreed
 what
 what are you talking about
 At&T, not you Drazilausti :P
 this dumbass tech support agent is continuing to tell me the passcode and SSN number i am giving him are wrong
 well you dont have to let out your anger here.
 ...
 thats what irc is for
 and of course... if there is any kind of disaster/life threatening emergency
 yes.
 you *have* to come on here first and tell everyone
 its like... the law
 We're quite good at connecting someone who is dying with local emergency ;)
 i actually saw an irc net that had a 911 service active
 really?
 hahaha
 turns out it wasnt for real life emergencies... just like if your channel is getting flooded
 ahh
 yea
 i was dissapointed :(
 hahahaha
 hmm.
 well if i cant make a proxy how will i watch youtube
 at school
 uhh
 setup your pc as a web server?
 I always thought school was for education ;)
 oh. how do i set up my computer as a server.
 and if school was for education i wouldnt be on a chatroom right now would i
 http://www.answers.com/sarcasm
 -_________________________________-
 but still how do i set up my computer as a web server
 u install a web server on it
 and forward port 80
 (or whatever port you want to host it on)
 and how do i get it to run files
 http://google.com
 why not ask them?
 I'm sure they can help you
 Note: making your personal computer into a public webserver paints a target on it
 because i like getting answers through chat.
 You will have to commit to keeping up with security updates
 hmm.
 For Apache, mod_php and anything else you're running on there
 That is exposes
 exposed*
 That or you could be a bit more intelligent, and make it only accessible via loopback and specific IP addresses/ranges
 So only the school could access it remotely
 :P
 Either way, I'd still say keep an eye on all updates
 i think i will stick with the idea of trying to find another host.
 Just because you're safer that way
 Drazilaustin: ssh/teamviewer works well
 teamviewer not quite so well thogh
 Paranoia is generally a benefit to a sysadmin ;)
 You wont find a free proxy host. I can almost guarentee it.
 ...
 ....
 is there other ways i could make it safe.
 Drazilaustin: ssh tunnel
 dont both with http proxy lark
 bother *
 hmm
 all you need is an ssh server & putty
 well. i am not sure if i can keep up with security
 you wont need to with ssh
 i wont.
 do you have a link or something i can view
 http://www.google.co.uk/aclk?sa=l&ai=CNSJrXfjdSv2sDpOy4gaIz5DKC5a0lDuy-Zv6AZW_wBQIABABIMeY-AVQgteKwv7_____AWC7vq6D0AqgAfWojP8DyAEBqgQaT9D8OWD0PuHvleviIgoGEJeMYndMuSktUgE&sig=AGiWqtzndGw9qzGnjQ-7PCV6M6HJ2YbCdg&q=http://www.vandyke.com/adword.php%3Fsource%3Dgoogle%26campaign%3D7%26creative%3D1

 how does a free host that offers 100gb transfer for free no ads sustain itself?
 well you see
 Other sites make up the slack
 the staff are all underground chimps smuggled into canada... so bananas are pretty cheap
 Thare are a few ads on the forum and around the place
 Also, we do have a few paid options
 for ex, 000webhost, I've never got my account activated there, they must receive thousands of accounts requets
 spaghettios ftw
 :D
 xD
 they're sitting here telling me the social security number on the account is wrong.
 oh.....
 That sucks
 i asked them if they thought I was an illegal immigrant making a social security number up?
 GRRRR
 But... AT&T are noted for their excellent service and consumer support! ;)
 They never did anything bad to me.
 You're lucky.
 Heh, I'm sure they have a good number of happy customers, or at least content ones, but the general image the company has is not good
 Verizon are the "good guys" so to speak over the pond iirc
 Yes.
 I wish we had an ISP that wasn't hated...
 But they're all fuckers :p
 AT&T isnt terrible, they're just a bunch of jackasses sometimes.
 Virgin Media's CEO has gone on record saying Net Neutrality is in his words "a load of bollocks" and that he's already making plans to get some customers traffic delivered faster than others
 lol
 haha :P
 BT and a fair few others did illegal trials of phorm, a DPI advertising service
 That invaded privacy with no opt-in from customers
 I just told this guy he was a joke
 Someone set a fucking passcode on my account
 and they refuse to tell me how it happened.
 Verizon are launching their new phone at the moment, targetted very much at the iphone :p
 The advert they've got amuses me
 I doubt it'll make huge impact, because it targets the lacking functionality in the iphone
 And the people buying it don't buy it because it's functional, they buy it because it's pretty :p
 (advert is http://droiddoes.com/ if you haven't seen)
 It's meant to be a really nice Android phone though, plus it'll be launched with Android 2.0, it may have that before the update gets pushed to other models
 ill bet that phone will be sexy :D
 This is just a fugacious visit... I want an early night :)

 You should recognise Ulan Bator as that ;)
 I mean, "What's the capitol of outer mongolia" is a common question, despite outer mongolia not really existing any more.
 One of the standard "I know how I can stump you!" questions that people then get annoyed with when they find out quite a lot of people actually know that ;)

 that picture
 makes no sense O_o
 Why?
 I understand it
 look @ the numbers
 Exactly
 That's why it's used in the context it is
 I understand it
 Finland kicked ass, it has been known to happen ;)
 Quite funny :P
 those numbers are insane XD
 Never underestimate local knowledge
 Especially in really bad enviroments
 And mountains count
 Tactics play a fairly pivotal role, and willingness to sacrifice.
 In some areas in WW2 single groups of armed men took out huge numbers of American tanks, there's a famous german officer who wrote a diary I think about his part of the war
 And he had control of a group at the end of a ravine or something like that, a thin approach with sheer walls, and they had an anti-tank gun set up at the end of it
 The way I heard it, the Americans just kept sending tanks down there, one by one
 And in his words "we ran out of ammo before they ran out of tanks"
 haha
 Nice
 I got a basic function working using the 2.x branch system
 Alex: Tech support fixed it
 Now I just have to move some of this code around, work on some of the specifics, then upgrade the old modules...
 Alex: the session_save.path wasnt set in my account lol
 Ah, well, I was right then :p
 I don't know how they managed that though
 not sure.
 It's probably because they're ecofriendly, and are powered by wind source. So they were trying to save some sessions to give to the less fortunate :D
 haha
 I'll betcha
 Bah I better start making a doc
 Sup
 But this is, Robert
 Well I wrote most of the doc
 I just got the simple version of rule to work
 Now for the other, more complex ones...
 I just started php :P all i have ever actually wrote by my self in php is: http://pastesite.com/11190
 ... Learning ...
 I don't understand.. why would he write this in the file "This code covers all the basics in PHP, variables, strings, and operators. Of course when you view the source of this page... "
 Especially when I can only see one operator used
 And all the variables are strings, so it's not really covering variables
 Is this free?
 They're idiots.
 The mind boggles :P

 Alright

 bbl
 Don't leave us TheOracle!
 I have an EeePC with a SSD
 hey
 yo
 man i dono where this extra padding or margin is coming from
 http://digennarodesigns.com/temp/
 the home button should be aligned with that left side
 driving me nuts :P
 its supposed to look like this, www.sharpielovers.com/images/grabs/hmUHV.png
 Why have you double defined #container?
 i didnt mean too
 let me look
 its onlyu there once
 Soz
 Lag
 no problem :D
 I came

 yays
 What's goin on?

 Buying this with Windows 7
 eww
 for a laptop upgrade :)
 windows 7
 I thought you had style, Jack
 W7 is meant to be very good
 just a vista reskin with features taken from os x imo
 You have obviously read the wrong articles
 Im a hardcode linux user :D
 Jack: it's not work it IMO
 you're better off getting XP
 ^
 worth it **
 thats what I use
 for games
 like
 fo3
 :D
 W7 is just what vista should have been
 XP is still faster
 and has less of the annoying piece of shit
 Lol XP
 Fuck me, is this 2003?
 XP is an awesome OS
 (by windows standards anyway.)
 You know are talking poo
 two*
 SSD
 +
 W7
 = fail
 not at all
 Pardon? :|
 SSD + Linux = win
 :D
 Jack: have you head anything about the UAC bugs ?
 hmmmm
 why does this script fail? http://digennarodesigns.com/temp/
 should center vertically
 some aussie found a way to launch apps that require UAC approval without them actually asking for it
 source code was released & a test program too
 microsoft said they're not going to fix it
 http://forums.overclockers.co.uk/showthread.php?t=18040306
 um, big security flaw???
 Pie` you are some fanboy, let me guess, Mac?
 lol
 rofl no
 mac can suck my dick
 Which Operating System is best for an SSD?
 Windows 7 is optimised for SSD's, it is around 10% faster than vista/xp, you can manually optimise settings in vista and xp yourself to improve performance, see here for more details: http://www.ocztechnologyforum.com/fo...ad.php?t=43460
 As stated earlier windows 7 also has TRIM built in so windows 7 really is the best choice for an SSD.
 have you guys updated to 7 yet?
 Never
 XP does what I want, I dont need anymore "features" aka bloat on my harddrive
 im still on xp, im tired of it but vista failed, cant decide whether to try 7 or not
 Lol XP
 Lol XP
 Lol XP
 Why would you adopt a windows operating system so early on? ;)
 kdigennaro: get windows ME ;)
 its the best os ever
 I may try 1998
 It can run on 64mb
 compatible with must of xp stuff?
 so can XP
 THINK OF THE RESOURCES SAVED
 hah :DF
 I have 95 on an old IBM on my desk
 Jack: http://i137.photobucket.com/albums/q219/ajjr1228/dadsshitcomplol.png
 you have an 8gig hdd?
 not me personally
 oo
 i see :P
 lol, IE
 But with 1998 it uses less cpu
 its IE6
 the best IE
 1998 is better than xp
 www.sharpielovers.com/images/grabs/v9Emm.png <-- mine
 IE6 is the worst
 Pie` - the home server I use for testing has 6GB
 oops crap lol
 http://www.stopie6.com/
 http://www.stopie6.com/
 forgot to scratch out number
 Jack: I never said use IE6 :p
 I just said it was the BEST IE

 hey
 bbl
 hehe no sBot
 wow, I've just found
 quite a serious bug in windows live
 windows live messenger *
 if you set your taskbar to auto-hide, and you take focus to a completely maximised program, windows live thinks its a fullscreen program and auto sets your status to busy
 (Unless you specifically tel it not to.)
 so i either have windows live settings my status to busy everytime it looses focus
 or i get alerts and message noises when im running fullscreen programs like games etc.
 I'm going to catch this error now...
 night zymic
 nn Dolleh 
 thnx dave XD

 Hurry up then Jacob I've not got all day.
 Nah, you can wait now.  ;)
 Oh, I got CMS working fine Jacob ;)
 ouch meanie!
 Within 5 minutes of setting it up.

 I had ./ at the beginning
 So?
 ./ is different to /
 Again, so? I don't care :)
 what the hell
 youtube has gone silent
 videos don't play any sound :(
 youtube is fine
 Jacob: nope
 because everyhting else still works
 k, perhaps its chrome
 k think its fixed now
 Let the logs show Brandon neglected to incl. the .htaccess files which the CMS is reliant on. So this is is fuck up, not mine. :P
 Excuse me?
 Honestly, I don't think anyone cares.. you got what you wanted not that you knew what you were doing, I mean.. you didn't even think about looking for a .htaccess file ;)
 Anyhoo, I gotta go gym. Ciao ladies.

 Yes
 but the patents are in review

 Lots of other companies are infringing
 nokia just want press
 XD
 meh
 Tim: do you know how tog et a ` on an ipod touch ?
 its kinda important that I do :p
 I can't find it on the keyboard anywhere
 tim.... is that a gogo on your desk? lol
 Not disagreeing, patents are a somewhat murky subject and I don't like to comment on what courts will do
 They're liable to do anything ;)
 But on the subject of other companies, Nokia claims to already have licensing deals
 no no
 Tim: do you know how tog et a ` on an ipod touch ?
 no and I dont care tbh

 im tryin to think of the best way to write commands for Jotta
 Proably should setup a nohup for it, may be the problem
 %fq
 wether to write the Commands as 1 class, or use the ScriptEngine class to parse JS files
 or implement Jython
 pyDelphi uses functions
 It allows for easily passing in global variables
 notably self
 Screw it, I'm just gonna write a class for em

 Heh
 My all time favorite film has to be Shaw shank Redemption what ever tis called :p
 Love that film
 Me too.
 Second one has to be Hard to Kill
 Third one will be Nowhere to run
 But, Hard Target is also another awesome film that stars Jean Claude Van Damme.
 I have Slumdog millionaire in my top 10 films to be honest. Truly awesome, not that many of you may agree but pfft :p
 hah jean claude van damme, there was a time we lived at other peoples place, they had ALL movies with him, heh watched them all rofl
 :)
 Jean Claude Van Damme is a legend.

 About the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard
 i watched this the other day. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1296869/
 TheOracle: how did you parse google results?
 JSON
 In the vein of "The Professional" and "Man on Fire", Steven Seagal plays an LA cop who after nearly being killed by his greedy partner, flees to New Mexico to work as a bodyguard for the daughter of a wealthy businessman. When mobsters kidnap her, he hunts them down to rescue her and protect her.  
 JSON ?
 Yes, JSON...
 %wik JSON
 "JSON, short for JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight computer data interchange format." - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON
 Thats how %digg is handled as well
 hah seen all movies from steven segal too, same people had all his movies too
 Bah

 It's Robert
 Dave: the departments which are taking industrial placements are largely their mathematical modelling, human factors and information processing branches
 But there's scope to look at most of the business BAES does if you get in :p
 Ahhh right I see. So you have an exam of some kind?
 I have a day long interview, it's termed an "assessment centre" :p
 Not really sure what it's going to entail
 Defence seems to take about half of the industrial placements though, there're a few
 BAES is one, and there's also DSTL, the Defense Science and Technology Laboratory
 Which takes all the contracts which are too internationally sensitive for the commercial R&D companies.
 That's interesting, it means you get Ministry of Defence security clearance if you get that placement :p

 Hey Rebel
 I don't need no Jewish translator ;)

 Just an Arabic
 Oh, that reminds me.  I assume that #php query is now answered, Jack?  I've not been at my laptop for most of the day.
 No Alex
 I know various ways but none are ideal
 Ø£Ø«Øº ÙØ´Ø¤Ù
 Hey Jack *
 I could just exclude the redirect and have /vpn/r123/ be a pseudo direct page but I like users to see clean URL's
 Hence the redirect.
 Rebel, what are your views for an Israeli / Palestinian resolution?
 This is random but I'm interested.
 not happening in the next 1 billion years
 :p
 most Israelis want the whole land, same for most Palestinians, so until they both change their minds the negotiations will be real 
 Sorry didn't mean to ignore your response Alex..
 I've come home for the weekend and just found out my Cardiff house got broken into last night .
 I have just watched 'Death in Gaza' film you see.
 Ah, shit, sorry to hear that
 Much damage, missing stuff?
 Yeh it's a bit crap
 link Jack?
 Dave, want to go find them and bust them up ZYMIC STYLE? :)
 came in through a window... took 2 laptops, one of the girls' handbags, ipod, external harddrive, digital camera and a few other bits.
 :9
 ho sorry to hear
 all while 2 people were in a sleeping.
 *and
 The camera man got murdered by the IDF
 The window was open?  Or did they smash it
 http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412631/
 That's sucks Dave
 not sure... haven't had all the details yet and police have quarantined the room while they do the whole CSI thing
 yeh :(
 they found a footprint apparently...
 aha ic 
 No finger prints yet?
 Always amuses me seeing those CSI vans go by, after you've seen the various CSI TV series, driving around in what, hummers etc :p
 Haha
 doing it all at the moment I think Brandon... don't know much as I'm here in Coventry
 And then you see the real British ones, in old Ford vans, with mud on them, and I imagine a few brushes, cameras and some plastic bags in the back
 When find out who did it make sure you find someone he/she is related to. Say.. his/hers mother of father or sister or brother then kidnap  them for a period of time :)
 heh yes I expect so.. but if they get results then I'm not complaining
 I'm sure they do good work, but it must be a shock for those who got into the field via TV inspiration
 To find that they don't actually get to be Horatio Cane ;)
 I couldn't stand horatio, anoyying guy
 Annoying*
 He's quite possibly the least researched character in history :p
 I fail typing, let me let me!
 I mean, he's part of the crime lab, but never actually does /anything/ in the lab ;)
 But I have to say I still find it entertaining
 the worst thing is the sounds computers make when they are working...
 or the animations etc.
 Not the lighting?  I always find that amusing
 also it's always green and black
 The whole building has orange lighting
 matrix style
 Does anyone want some compressed air cans?
 I took it upon myself to clean my laptop keyboard
 I'm never doing that again
 Rofl.
 E.g taking each key off, removing the clips, then blowing with air and removing 2 years worth of grime and hair 
 Tis annoying
 wow my keyboard sounds clean :P
 Take the key's off
 Mine did look clean :p
 well, it does look clean under the keys too, HAH!
 All of them?
 too lazy to take them all off, took 9 off around enter key
 Lie
 Aye, LIES!
 no lie :P
 Jack.... get a job
 ;)
 David
 XD
 You sound like my parents

 I'll pay you to come and blow my keys...

 For example, Intel's X25-M SSD's are MLC, and they are rated to last for 100GB of writes every day, for 5 years. No home user would write 100GB to an SSD every day, so an Intel SSD is likely to last 10-15+ years, by which time, technology will have advanced anyway.

 "The more exclamation points used in an email (or other posting), the more likely it is a complete lie. This is also true for excessive capital letters." - The Law of Exclamation
 TheOracle is cool!!!!!!!!!
 "It is reminiscent of the claim in Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels that the more exclamation marks someone uses in writing, the more likely they are to be mentally unbalanced. According to Pratchett, five exclamation marks is an indicator of "someone who wears their underwear on the outside"."

 its in the shadow of the building though
 the nose is just out of the shadow
 Interesting, it is.
 the building is only 10 stories tall

 I'm not too sure Brandon
 :P
 For some reason keeping pyDelphi alive is like trying to keep a child's attention
 If I don't send a command every once and awhile then it "sleeps"
 Once it sleeps then you have to send the same command twice to wake it back up again, its very odd

 I think my brother jacked up his computer
 You see, the light switch is wired to turn off all the outlets downstairs
 Since he kept flipping the switch, I think its corrupted the hard drive via power surges because he never turned off the power strip
 b/c he would flip the switch to turn on the lights, the power would surge the computer, then he'd turn off the lights again
 whoops!
 I did a CHKDSK but it exited before I could see the results
 The computer shuts down randomly
 TheOracle: theres an output file
 addr.?
 try running it again but this time:
 chkdsk > C:\chk.log
 Pie` I can't, it takes so god damn long
 do you want to see results? ;)
 It'll probably shut down by the time it finishes or before
 The only way it finished before was b/c I told it to do it the next time the computer started
 nevermind, figured it out... just have to wait 'til the computer starts back up
 Jesus, pyD crashed again

 Does anyone know a project tracker thats easy to use that can track bugs, new changes/fixes and is preferably open-source?
 like subversion ?
 Yes, but for people who arent computer "pros"
 ie typical vista users lol
 "It came with my PC, so I use it!"
 woah, adjusting my monitor made everything sharper :D
 howd u adjust it
 cause mines not very sharp
 its sorta fuzzzy
 DarkKrai: you should try git
 Its very easy once you learn the basics
 there isnt git for windows
 most people that will work on the project wouldnt delve into cygwin
 A git client or a git repository?
 client
 Easy
 sec
 http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/
 You have to get http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/ as a dependency though
 It works inline with windows explorer though, quite nice
 its basically TortoiseSVN for git
 I use tortoisesvn
 its awesome :D
 Same here.
 Yea, I used it when I worked with mediawiki
 Its a very nice client, TortoiseGit is the same, but for git.
 Same features as TortoiseSVN thougj
 though*
 what about web based?
 I don't think there's such a thing, google it
 I mean
 a project tracker, but web based
 Sourceforge, GitHube
 Hub*
 SourceForge uses SVN or CVS, can't remember.
 They use SVN.
 You could setup your own git frontend though like I did
 Nice.
 One.
 Bob ?

 Apparently there's something wrong with my socket
 Its not the loop, its not dispatch()...
 It all comes down to the final output to IRC

 what versions
 I dunno :)
 it syas
 bottom right corner
 or myb bottom left
 when ur on main menu
 :/
 I'm not going on it
 thought you were >_>
 I have to download mac version :( lol

 well if you haven't got v1.7.6 of cod4
 you'll be ok

 but dont know if i should
 why do i want it?! heh
 My step dad bought it for Â£30 :p
 Off ebay though
 yeah
 It's pretty cool if you ask me :P
 i can get it with my student email
 :)
 i've heard alot of bad reviews about it
 ie, it very noticably slowing down within a month of installing (with only like 3 extra programs on) etc
 bsod within 3 hrs of having it set up
 :p
 but alot relating to it slowing down etc.
 None of which has happened to me ;)
 It still running very fast on my test computer.
 Odd then
 if i got time on pay day i'll get it just for the sake of having a legit copy
 but i doubt i'll use it
 Just say it's all down to the user who don't know how to use a computer :P
 lol
 :P
 Also, everytime I turn it off I put it in hibernation and when I turn it back on it takes like 18 seconds to return to windows in working order no slowness occurs as it would on vista and xp.
 Apparently
 I cant boot my own external hard drive
 because it uses space on the computer?
 wat
 makes no sense
 You can.
 the OS would be run off the hard drive
 *external
 No, I know I can
 Earlier on I took out a laptop HDD and put it in a caddy and booted up to vista on it lol.
 i gotta figure out why my other computer is giving me problems.
 my teacher misunderstood me
 What's wrong with it?

 the hdd's get very hot.
 but randomly when it's running, the entire system slows down
 im in your computer
 thats why its hot in there
 like frame rate is like 1 per sec.
 Hm
 happens on diff os' too
 Could be faulty HDD's or Faulty ram
 RAM*
 Pretty sure i tried diff hdd's
 i did take one stick of ram out
 didnt try swapping after tho
 Hm, Download "Memtest" and what ever the make of the HDD is download the Manufactures HDD test tool thing to see if it's any of that. If not, it could be mainboard of CPU.
 But, it's rare to be CPU/MB unless it's suffered from great impact of course :p
 yeah
 My brother once said his computer is doing his head in and asked me to look at it.. he called me up saying he's going to lose the plot. Went over there and he's had a hammer to it lol.

 Hello Brandon
 'Sup?
 nm really just hungry, u ?
 Cool. Not to much, just getting ready to go work in a bit.
 You should do what I do.. eat every two hours :)
 haha I would but got no food, ooh do you normally start work this late?
 4PM to 12AM.
 But dad closes up at 11:45PM to give the security guard to lock everything down etc :P

 Because the middle is a little empty
 Unless you are going to add more.
 not really going to add more

 ED YOU BASTARD
 I think Dolleh deserves a kb for that :o
 nuhu
 ed probs fell asleep on his keyboard anyway ;)
 I can do whatever I want >D
 mwhaha
 Ed, I would be worried. She's going to do something to you that you're not gonna regret tbh ;).
 :O
 how did you knew?
 damn I shouldn't write my evil plans down!
 night zymics, more evil plotting needed
 Nooooooooooooo don't leave us Dolleh! You're the only sane one among us.
 I know sbot, and I feel terribly sorry for you... poor poor bot...
 Night
 You're a sloth Brandon, sleep at this time... you should be ashamed!
 Hey Ed, are you active?
 no he fell asleep duh
 Anyone that is familiar with IRC? As in installing and setting up and IRC server
 Me :)
 Perry, Ed isn't the one you should be asking. Alex is, he helped me from time to time ;).
 Perry - what are you wanting one for?
 Nosey fucker :p
 Robert - I just want to learn to set one up and get it running, just to broaden my understandings.
 Always fun :p
 Haha, did you set one up, Brandon?
 Several times.
 A few times with Alex's help as I mentioned above but then I got the hang of it and can do it well :)
 On different servers?
 Or re-installs?
 hi
 I've installed UnrealIRCd and InspIRCd on tdd's server to play with and one on my friends home server
 Brandon - you host it off a Linux desktop, correct?
 Linux server, aye :p
 do you know how to install joomla
 Maybe you should learn that for yourself?
 Yes, we do... But ^
 ok dont be helpful then
 http://help.joomla.org/content/view/39/132/
 I thought Zymic was just a hosting provider not a 3rd party web application installer >.<
 there is a tutorial on how to set it up. but it doesnt work. but obviosly its allowed
 otherwise the tutorial would not be there
 Thanx perry
 Read it carefully and ensure you haven't forgotten something.
 Yes
 http://game-pass.co.cc please give me advice on how to improve. 
 What is the name of that song playing in the video?
 what video the one on the home page
 Rofl.
 Yes
 Obviously.. no other video on there >.<
 evenesance - bring me to life perry
 ty
 Brandon, why so angry tonight?
 there is more videos on the site brandon
 Blame the indians.
 Iam indian
 Really?
 No  LOL
 You're from the UK.
 He/she must be 12 years old :)
 Yes bradford. The place has loads of indians
 Curry capital = bradford (search google)
 Where you from Brandon US
 Nope, United Kingdom
 Wow where bouts
 Lets just say he has an affinity for sheep...
 Nice away message Brandon :P Fak off
 Are you mods you guys
 On what?
 You should probably take that back, Robert.
 After all, I'm not welsh ;)
 Awww, spoil my fun :p
 Are you lot moderators
 Where?
 on Zymic
 Some are
 Some aren't
 ok 
 Perry: Listen to this; Customer calls up saying his IE (Internet Explore) is crashing and after awhile his laptop will BSoD. Indian 'says' to customer to contact his ISP for some help... WTF!
 Stupid Indians, really frustrates me :(
 hahahaha
 HAHA
 they dont know what they are on about
 Nor do you, so meh!
 :)
 :(
 :-/
 When the call center was based in England it was cool you could make some sense out with what the Indians had written but since they've moved the call center to India you have to find the fault that the customer sent it in for, usually if it's from Comet stores they send in a bit a paper with details etc on it and what the fault is which is always a great help.. english person that makes 110% sense :p
 clouts me. (he wishs)
 ;-)
 Ah baby in a backet
 Nohup didn't work...
 :-}
 the command did'nt work Wtf
 Benpadgett != Ben?
 How old are you, Benpadgett?
 No, sroracle.
 B-)
 I see
 and again
 Brandon is a 50 y.o. pedo
 Oh hello Jake
 I am off
 mibbit commands
 Gotta fix that...
 [19:54:04] <Brandon> Perry: Listen to this; Customer calls up saying his IE (Internet Explore) is crashing and after awhile his laptop will BSoD. Indian 'says' to customer to contact his ISP for some help... WTF!
 haha
 Jacob: Why do you insist on sharing my secrets with the world? :(
 are u a pedo
 really i am being serious
 No, he's not
 As far as I know
 he is or isnt
 PyCon should be in Chicago
 Benpadgett: I am, you wanna come to my bedroom? ;)
 Brandon is too young to be a pedo.
 Liverpool are the best. Nice victory yesterday
 Man u did you like that hammering
 Uh, what?
 What was that in english? :/
 football
 Liverpool are the best
 That doesn't justify any meaning still
 <Benpadgett> Man u did you like that hammering
 Liverpool beat Man Utd 2-0 recently
 Aye, oh well.
 yes correct
 Not a football fan.
 (coming off a streak of four losses to be fair)
 Yes but against man u it cant be bad
 Is this American Football or UK Football?
 uk
 There is like 5 Americans at work and they say UK is so much better than America :p
 What brandon
 I can't compare the two since I don't have much knowledge and/or experience for the UK
 I wish to go there sometime
 The Americans I know who came over for uni for a year liked it
 Especially all the pubs :p
 Heh :p
 I am a CEO
 Of?
 Benpadgett: You never answered my question. How old are you? ;)
 45
 Bull.
 You certainly don't type like it
 Heh, I was thinking that myself :p
 i am a fast typer and dont put much care into it
 its only a chat box not every thing needs to be perfect
 Wasn't really talking about how fast you can type.
 Alex is like a god.
 You should atleast try to structure your messages, even if a little
 why its only a chatbox
 What is it... 100 words in 10 seconds? XD
 It helps for clarity and people actually treat you with respect
 i have enough respect thank you
 sroracle is 12 years old and types better than us both ;).
 Brandon,
 :(
 Shh.
 You know that hurts my feelings
 ohh well i told you i dont care about my typing
 you have to be 13 at least to enter zymic
 Aww, I do. I care about mine!
 why 
 Fair enough, just don't expect people to put effort into replies if there's no effort going into the original message
 That's general IRC policy
 Exactly :)
 yes i sai that i type like this because it is only a chatbox
 Sounds like Newton's Law of motion really
 Chatbox? Oh dear.
 'Only a chatbox'?
 Hah.
 IRC is somewhat more sophisticated than "a chatbox"
 Thats the understatement of the year.
 Yes i can set up irc
 Rofl.
 And I suppose we don't count as real people either, so don't deserve proper english
 Wow!
 through mibbit
 lol...
 O.o
 Uh, if you mean an IRC server, no.
 Mibbit does not offer IRC hosting, its merely a web client.
 A petty one at that - I dislike it very much.
 i own mibbit
 I'm highly amused at this moment in time :)
 *noob web client
 Rofl.
 Well.
 I'd like proof, sir.
 i wouldnt like to show sufficient proof within a chatbox
 Then you're a liar.
 Chatbox?
 Jeez
 i wouldnt like to give sufficient proof within a chatbox
 Lmao.
 What a wanker.
 Oh great.
 Oh, he's back.
 Forgot how to use mibbit for a second there?
 Like I was going to say:
 i wouldnt like to show sufficient proof within a chatbox
 Benpadgett Just create a random page on mibbit, that'll do for us
 Just a hello world somewhere, say www.mibbit.com/onfweukjfrelorfe.php
 If you can't provide proof that you own Mibbit, then I'm going to have to assume you don't on the basis that most people bullshit like this all the time over the internet.
 Its so pointless.
 When that page exists and says Hello World, we'll concider believing you
 I am not bull shitter
 Everyone knows your a liar, come clean before nobody respects you anymore
 i own mibbit
 We're giving you the opportunity to demonstrate that, Benpadgett
 God damn
 not in a chatbox
 Do as Robert suggests, and we'll believe you, it doesn't harm you in anyway
 Why not?
 any way*
 Benpadgett What hosting company do you use?
 And don't spend ages finding out
 5 seconds, as you should know this
 i own a hosting company
 Which one?
 WOAG
 O________O
 *WAOH
 look at this KID
 Only joking
 You do not own mibbit.
 17 minutes, it appears.
 Cr`eme is a mibbit lover
 Wait, he owns a hosting company yet he hosts at Zymic.com. Priceless :)
 Lol.
 Protip: jokes should contain humour
 i like the feature of zymic and the wonderful respecting community
 If you own mibbit. Add a logo for holoween.
 :)
 to much production work
 Cr`eme That changes the site, so is hardly fair
 True enough, we respect everyone who deserves it :p
 My idea on the other hand would take all of 2 minutes to do
 True
 cost of development as well
 lol
 ?
 Benpadgett: You don't win respect over the Internet by lying. You lose it.
 Writing hello world costs money
 ?
 Benpadgett <?php echo "Hello World"; ?>
 You can have that for free
 Doesn't even need to be PHP
 how do you know i am lying
 I've just asked the owner of Mibbit to join the Zymic IRC when he's about
 Lol
 Because you can't prove you own Mibbit
 yes i have arrived
 OBVIOUS troll is OBVIOUS, guise
 Its obvious that you're some 11 year old from God know's where trying to be "cool".
 T_T
 *12
 to be cool
 you have to be at least 12
 DarkKrai: You're not helping.
 because thats one less year than 12
 because 12 = 12
 i dont need to try being cool i know i am cool
 Wow.
 yes
 Well if you are so "cool" Show us the damn proof.
 Your ego's size is bewilders me.
 i dont like doing somthing called 'showing off'
 Let's review from a previous idiot, shall we?
 Benpadgett: You seem to be doing a bit of it.
 1. You aren't cool if you say it. So shut up.
 Benpadgett, that isnt showing off.
 2. You're not cool by pretending to be something you're not.
 That is showing us proof.
 3. You're not cool by lying.
 i will check the inbox at mibbit thank you
 ;_;
 Alright then, here's a free solution.
 Respond to me right now then!
 Create the email address imtellingthetruth@mibbbit.com
 servers are going down
 Then send someone here an email from ther
 e
 HOMG
 :<
 You lier
 I heard the mibbit owner was here
 Hello, Sindacious
 Yes
 where?
 Oh wow. Sockpuppeting.
 He is a lier.
 yes iam 
 TheOracle I could send an e-mail from there
 The absolute lowest form of an idiot.
 I hope you wouldn't be referring to me as a sock puppet
 in you world yes TheOracle
 Benpadgett, you own mibbit?!
 yes 
 check
 Maybe not a sockpuppet since your hosts are different, but maybe its a setup.
 Just to fill everyone in, Sindacious is Mibbit staff, Benpadgett 'owns' Mibbit
 http://wiki.mibbit.com/index.php/Staff
 if proof is needed
 TheOracle be quiet
 Benpadgett, how was the wedding?
 good thanks
 nice
 look at these trolls
 *troll
 DarkKrai? These?
 dont be too harsh on yourself DarkKrai
 funny
 it will get you down
 Benpadgett, what happened yesterday?
 I was afk most the day
 so I missed the action 
 I'm here for the owner of mibbit, his site told me to contact him here?
 shut up look
 What?
 yes hello
 yeah, you best be trollin, son
 O_o
 haha
 troll troll troll
 Who is look?
 kicked
 Darkrai
 xD
 what?
 you best be trollin
 Right I'm getting bored of this, we all know the truth
 !kb Benpadgett
 that was fairly funny
 lol
 lol.
 Glad he's gone :p
 Sindacious I'm sorry for Brandon getting you over here for this waste of time
 haha
 no problem
 fun is fun
 Yeah, but 15 minutes of it is extreme :p
 :P
 He fails.
 I'm sure he made a good ass out of himself
 He did :p
 Yep, I think the best one was claiming to own a hosting company
 We ARE a hositng company, he's here for support!
 lol
 that's quite funny
 I'm terribly sorry Sindacious, I really thought you were with Benpadgett there.
 it happens
 :P
 Sindacious: Did Axod really have a wedding? Heh.
 Or even went to one.
 went to, yeah
 I should have said beach
 :P
 I wonder if Benpadgett was hiring... should have asked tbh,
 .*
 bet you could make some good money from benpadgetthosting(TM)
 We'll never know now :(
 Anyhoo, be right back ladies.
 blueyonder.co.uk -> virginmedia.com
 he owns Virgin Media
 haha
 He thought otherwise I suppose
 Guess not
 Er
 I'm afraid if he's just going to join spam, I'm going to ban again
 looks like he's from the soviet union now.
 lol

 they said no.
 but...
 apple is cool. so...
 "get a new one off the shelf"

 i happen to have a friend i hardly ever see working there as manager:P
 **chuffed**
 i need an opinion about something
 what should i do about the text on this page http://d-gen-y.zxq.net/editcard.php?type=monster
 it doesnt blend well with the background
 no color that i try works
 Drazilaustin: get a different background
 that one is horrible
 Yayyyy
 Apple Tech said my harddrive is on its way to failing soon :)
 Elliott
 can someone help me?
 what does Notice: Use of undefined constant delete - assumed 'delete' in /www/zxq.net/d/-/g/d-gen-y/htdocs/index.php on line 36
 mean
 Drazilaustin: a simple example which triggers that notice is this:
 $foo = bar;
 If bar is not a defined constant (defined by define('bar','contents') or similar)
 Then PHP will just assume it was meant to be a string 'bar'
 The problem here, is that it ends up that the script has undefined behaviour
 If you have a PHP file with the contents <?php $foo = bar; ?>
 Then, depending on whether you go to it directly, or if that file is included
 It could do two completely different things
 The easy demonstration of that is if file1.php is <?php $foo = bar; ?> and file2.php is <?php define('bar',17); include 'file1.php'; ?>
 Sorry, if file1.php is <?php $foo = bar; echo $foo; ?>
 Otherwise it's not really a demonstration :p
 Anyways, if you visit those two files, you find that in one case, $foo is a string 'bar' and in the other it's an integer 17
 The fact you have no certainty how the code will behave means it's fairly bad practice
 :)
 well put, Alex

 Writing a datasource for CakePHP, just a simple one for now
 But the documentation for what to expect is... interesting
 Oh, ok.
 So I've decided that the best way is simply to var_dump anything I get given, and see what it is

 Well before you go, I hope you turn into a handbag TheOracle
 Yullin: well, asking in the hosting support channel would be a good start
 It's #hosting this is #zymic
 This channel is not an alternative

 Well, in that case, it's just as well I told him this isn't an alternative

 Not the auto uploading per se
 But screengrab does nice images of open websites
 nvm, found one.

 Nice to see you exhausted all avenues of private research before asking
 I should point out, I'm tired and going to sleep soon, so I'm not really in the best mood to suffer foolish queries ;)

 just had a general question, how long does the free term last here on zymic?

 Git Extensions is a nice client

 We use GIT
 At work?
 YEp
 Its indeed a nice SCM
 The version control right?
 Yes
 Cool.
 We use that and Sharepoint's built in one
 You should try Git Extensions if you haven't already
 Do you know how to make git ignore files beginning with "~"? I've tried several different combos in .gitignore but none seem to work
 geesh I already got  new boss?! wth..
 Just popped in to say: PARTY! I gonna love this night, gotta go   -   PARTY! Good day Zymics!

 At least there is some logic work and some assembly in this module... so it's not just hardware
 Honestly, I don't really care how bits of hardware interact, as long as it works it could be magic as far as I care ;)
 I just want to get to writing software on it
 :)
 holy cow this is awesome
 ?
 my friend made a program in Java which you use as a proxy for your torrent client
 Grea..
 t..
 as the client uplaods data to the tracker its sent tot he proxy which edits the data to make the tracker think you're uploading more than you really are
 VERY useful for private torrent sites that ban you if your ratio goes < a certain number
 Okay, I suppose that's awesome :P
 it does it at a realistic rate too
 so you dont end out with like 150mb download and 100000gb uploaded
 My mate in work downloaded 140GB+ over one night :(
 Guess what it was..
 If you're worried about your ratio
 Porn
 Get one of the server-based torrent apps, the ones you get with a web interface
 Nope. Star track :(
 Star Trek*
 :p
 You set it downloading and seeding, then just download direct when it's done :p
 No, Star Gate
 And you can actually get those ridiculous ratios legitimately
 :p
 I'd like to know how you know this Mr I don't like torrenters.
 I don't like illegal torrents
 I have no problem with the concept of peer to peer file distribution
 Lol. Illegal torrents?
 Aren't like 99% of them illegal?
 And it's very common for Linux distros
 ^
 What's your point?
 There are still plenty of legitimate ones
 And there's definitely an ethical difference
 Like? (without linux distros)
 IIRC, if you're downloading something you already own it isn't illegal
 so like if you bought a DVD and then went and downloaded the same DVD off a torrent, its not illegal
 I am sure it would be Pie` 
 I think iPlayer used BitTorrent under the hood for distributing legit content for example, Jacob
 Downloading anything that is sold to make profit is illegal, Pie` 
 That's another fairly large scale example
 but Jacob, you've already paid for it
 But you haven't answered what your point was
 The ratio of illegal to legal is pretty irrelevant
 I am wondering what life would be like only using Linux...
 No silly Windows issues.
 the only issue I have with linux is that setting dual monitors up is a complete whore
 Not on nvidia cards
 designing and work would be a pain for me
 I have an nvidia card ;)
 Then you're a failure :p
 I do windows work all the time
 nvidia's drivers include a graphical application which can set up dual monitors in 20 seconds flat
 mine didn't
 i had to install & configure it myself

 Yeah
 http://files.pastesite.com/screenshots/apps/nvidia.png
 its using like 60% cpu again
 yeah that's what I have now, but I had to congiure it myself
 Not that X.org configuration is usually that bad anyway, but that app makes it a breeze for anyone really
 The screenshot was off the configuration app not the fact I have dual monitors :p

 alex`cts: my screen res is bigger than yours :D
 2960x1050
 As I said, that's an old image, I can do better if you want
 All that really tells me is your loaded with cash.
 I can't :(
 Because in addition to those displays, I've also got an HD TV
 I have a nice 16" Lappy screen.
 my tv only goes up to 1680x1050
 So I have had a 1024x768 attached onto the end
 and my secondary monitor does 1280x0124 max
 It's not a large HD TV, it's a small one
 But it is an extra display
 I couldn't live without 1 monitor again
 </Alex's Gloat?

 2 makes it so much easier
 Jacob: I think you'll find I didn't start this competition, I just won.  No need to be bitter ;)
 Lol.
 I do not care. :)
 I have two at work.
 Not big ones though.
 Just 1200-ish ones
 Anyways, practical over, later folks
 :)
 Also, Jacob I see no point in 16" screens for notebooks. Bit big for portable tbh.
 I think this is 15-16
 Can't remmeber
 15.4" is also too big.
 I have 13.3" :)
 Widescreen of course.
 has anyone here seen the informant?
 Nope.
 Not me, what's it about?
 IDK yet, was gonna ask if anyone thought it was good :p
 :p
 Is it a recent release?
 yes
 its noto ut on DVD yet
 Ah, I'll go watch :)
 fucking hell zone alarm is being a bitch...

 Having a break Jacob? Don't forget your kit kat
 its created this process vsmon, its using like 60% of my cpu
 Okay, no I will not watch. If I'm going to download a film, it has to be DVD Rip :p

 On server I could get more than 14mb :p

 I downloaded something on a windows server in the UK and the download speed was atleast 8Mb/s

 hello sir
 i have hosted free website in ur service
 What's your problem?
 Don't pm me
 It's annoying
 i pm myself sometimes if i want to quietly enter a different room like #php
 Drazilaustin Why would you need to pm yourself to enter another room?
 Mymedia Shall we try that again?
 hello sir my site got banned
 What is your problem?
 What is your site?
 i dont know any other ways other than to type it
 Type /join #php
 Or, the other way, /part #php
 Hello Mymedia What is your site?
 oj
 And what did you upload?
 join #php
 And can you please stop quiting
 uh
 Drazilaustin WITH the slash
 nvm. it works
 It's not there for decoration
 If he join/quits again, I'm banning him
 it works
 thanks
 Ah ha. I don't suggest quiting Mymedia
 What is your site name?
 wouldnt this be better asked in #hosting
 bye
 Good night Drazilaustin

 hey guys..
 anyone have any ideas where i can find dedicated servers... but sheaply?
 *cheaply
 sec
 nevermind, I doubt $200-$300/mo is cheap for you ;-)
 lol.
 i need root access..
 i'm setting up a hosting company:)
 I see.
 not to compete with zymic...:)
 Well, this plan is 1000GB (read: 1 TB) of bandwidth, 500GB, 2GB RAM, an Intel Q9550
 lol. im starting a company with a friend..... he designs... i host. :)
 500GB HDD*
 kk
 for 200 a month?
 $249
 hmm.
 Plus there's a $100 setup fee :|
 maybe i should think  about virtual servers atm...
 until we get more clients.
 They do offer VPS
 )
 what companyy?
 Although the specs are low
 yeah.... they're pretty much same as zymic packages...
 :P
 200GB, 3125GB (read: @ 3 TB) bandwith, 2048 MB "Guaranteed" RAM, Free setup, $129/mo
 thats not too bad tbh.
 %c 3125 GB as TB
 3125 GB as TB = 25/8
 yh..
 Take a look: http://www.webhostingbuzz.com/vps-web-hosting.php
 thx.
 They offer lower-level plans for VPS`s as well if you want to go lower
 The plan I described was PLATINUM-NG
 Which is the highest VPS they offer
 I've personally used their regular web hosting and they have an excellent support staff
 cool.:)
 i think i miht go with them:P
 Alright
 but im in the UK... so it might be a bit weird:P
 I'm sure PayPal can work that out ;-)
 :)
 but with exchange rates.... my fees will change every month:P
 Ah true
 oh well.
 its never gonna go overÂ£25 a month on a $25 package..
 lol.

 if you leave a flash application open for too long in chrome, it starts to use an exceedingly high amount of CPU

 Arguably the more correct 40th birthday is today

 Its disturbing
 IRC is nearly dead in other channels
 yeah... you would almost think he has a life now :O
 maybe he's married and has 6 children secretly...
 maybe he's married to 6
 ^
 wives, that is
 Heh, those poor children, all in one room because he needs space for all his servers
 Hah
 and every wife has 6 kids
 rofl truefact alex lol
 and every kid has 6 wives
 and every wife has six kids
 lies darkkrai
 he has over 9000 children
 ahw gawd
 productive little bugger he is
 they arent his children
 Ed is infertile
 seriously: since no one at #hosting is giving me any answers, is uuuq.com hosting unavailable?
 6 dolleh's D:
 GAWD thats HORRIBLE
 [18:05:52] <Dolleh> and every wife has 6 kids
 6 *  6 = 36
 He banged you 36 times, Dolleh D:

 Mc128k: That's LP for you. Just ignore it
 all right ;)
 Yo guys, which html/css/js/php editor do you guys recommend?
 notepad++ or vim :p
 Vim.org?
 Yes
 Just so you know to expect it, Vim has a learning curve
 It's arguably more efficient once you've learned how it works.  You can do a lot of fairly complex stuff all without moving your hands from the keyboard
 Unless you need a wee of course ;)
 but its only you that has bladder issues Brandon ;)
 A bladder issue? Everybody needs to dehydrate :p
 Dead By Sunrise is a shitty band.
 somebody speak duth here?
 dutch?
 yes brandon
 Dolleh, somebody wants to talk to you ;)
 ahw damn D: stalkers?
 ah I see, dutch person
 hallo kanjertje63, ik spreek nederlands? :P
 dat is fijn dolleh
 waarom krijg ik ineens een hele ander apgina
 pagina
 ik wilde op de voetbalsite
 welke voetbalsite?
 voetbalstreams,zxq.net
 omdat de eigenaar van de website de regels van zymic heeft overtreden
 ow oke 
 bedankt dan weet ik voldoende
 de site is dus geschorst
 Seems like it's ignore the topic and rules day ;)
 graag gedaan
 damn you alex :P
 I'm fine with you guys chatting in Dutch, but rules say in #zymic-nl or in PM
 do we got a dutch chanel then?
 Make one
 Or not, seems it is no longer necessary
 :P
 But yeah, #zymic-[countrycode] is the thing the rules suggests, we've just never had enough people speaking in a foreign language to make them permanent
 :)
 #Zymic seems to have many english people :o
 No problem with that, England is a nice place... mostly
 well next time some random dutch person asks for someone who speaks dutch, i'll just handle it in pm :P dpn't think enough dutch people will haunt in here to make a special channel for it lol
 Don't*
 damnit :P
 Damn it*
 *Do not
 xD

 !translate on Brandon
 i have some question about hosting, anybody who can help me?
 Lo siento
 Brandon: Sorry
 iMy: Where are you from?
 hungary
 why?
 I'll talk to you in spanish then :)
 lol
 :)
 Hola IMY, Â¿en quÃ© puedo ayudarle?
 Brandon: IMY Hello, how may I help you?
 :P
 :D
 !translate off Brandon
 so, moment, i have to translate my problem to english:D
 my page write a warning: Notice: Undefined index: nickname in /www/zzl.org/m/i/n/minimaltherapy/htdocs/login.php on line 3
 but, before i upload it to the host, i run it my computer with appserv
 You're trying to access part of an array that doesn't exist at runtime
 and it run perfectly
 You should be checking isset() before using it
 hm, okay, i try it
 Unfortunately, a lot of distributions of PHP use php.ini-dist rather than php.ini-recommended, and that means your PHP in appserv might have the E_NOTICE level errors suppressed
 Notices are not really errors, they're low-level warnings which inform you about bad coding practices which could lead to errors
 In this case you're referring to data that doesn't exist
 i know it
 i can't disable it, i think :S
 Well, if you already know all about it, why do you need to ask?
 :P
 You shouldn't be disabling notices, you should be fixing the code so notices are not generated in the first place
 okay, thank you
 hey all
 hey TO, hey pypy
 oh wow, FML i'm someone's big example, wow thats sad
 can you pick worse?
 Wha?
 I read on DA, some sort of about page wich has the question 'who's your big example?' the awnser was 'moose'

 Who ever talks last yes, all I have to do is hit tab then your name will come up in the input field :)
 Brandon: See?
 Pooplah!
 Er what... I didn't know I could make tabs smaller :O http://grab.by/dUZ
 TheOracle: But, don't you have to do "b" first then tab or can you just hit tab and "Brandon" will come up? :p
 Nope, no letter
 Just <TAB>
 Brandon: 
 :o
 If its not at the beginning of the line, then there's no colon
 i.e. blah blah Brandon
 Aye, cool. They've only just added that in to this client, gay :
 :P*
 :)
 I've asked the developer of it to add a button in the right click so when you right click a username you have the option to see previous conversations with that person rather than looking for them.
 uhoh

 Hey
 Does anyone use software similar to Dreamweaver?
 I am looking for open source alternatives.
 I only use it for tag auto completion, preview windows below code, etc.
 I think CoffeeCup can do that
 sec
 I would prefer not to use NotePad/++
 Try this: http://www.coffeecup.com/free-editor/
 I think it meets your citeria but its not loading for me right now
 criteria*
 "Split-Screen Preview lets you view your Webpage in a browser right from inside the Code Editor."
 Its not below though :|
 Yeah not loading, I think I found what I was looking for: http://www.aptana.org/
 Aye, andy uses that
 Pretty cool
 Haha
 freenode just had a mass-kill
 [13:46:48] [Md] [GlobalNotice] sorry for the recent mass-kill issue! we are investigating what happened exactly
 Nearly everyone in #defocus got killed sequentially, and now they're all joining
 [13:48:50] <tonsofpcs> 14:46:53 -!- Netsplit lindbohm.freenode.net <-> irc.freenode.net quits: @ChanServ
 [13:49:06] <tonsofpcs> 14:46:44 -!- ChanServ [ChanServ@services.] has quit [Killed by sagan.freenode.net (Nick collision)]
 Makes you feel lucky that I've only got the one real node to look after, no chance of netsplits :p
 Can't really avoid them as you get larger
 Yep
 This one is big too
 ChanServ is still not up, people are saying freenode got hacked
 Could just be hysteria though
 True, ChanServ still isn't back... but hacking I dunno
 http://pastie.org/679159.txt
 It does seem like rather a leap
 well a lot of people have turned into Guests now
 http://grab.by/dW9
 Chanserv is back by the way
 Course thats probably just their clients
 yea
 Services were back up five minutes before you said they were still down ;)
 [13:55:13] <Cprossu> I received a message (12:45:04 PM) syn.: (notice) *** Disconnecting you (syn (Banned)) <- should I be worried?

 Lul.
 I'll try and connect
 Things seem back to normal for me
 everyone is freaking though
 Define everyone :p
 I don't see anyone freaking out in the channels I'm in
 What might they be? ;)
 ##c++, ##slackware, #slackbuilds, #kde and #qt
 It's not exactly a secret :p
 :P
 So, now I know where you're gonna be incase IRC dies again ;)
 Fine, provided you check that link I posted on the forums when it went down last beforehand
 Because that'll tell you if the server is inaccessible, in which case I can't do anything about it :p
 Heh, yep I've seen.
 I wonder how many times still you will have to say that Alex 
 :p
 Dave <3
 Its weird
 hey Brandon
 people trying to join #freenode are sometimes forwarded to ##Overflow, some aren't
 Yet the limit hasn't been reached
 There is also possibly a limit of N joins per M seconds
 Probably
 In which case, a rush of people returning from being killed would cause that behavior
 But lets not let common sense get in the way of hysteria ;)
 [Global Notice] Hi all, as you will have noticed a rather large percentage of our users were just killed by a bug in a utility bot.  We've taken it offline and are investigating the cause.  Sorry for the inconvenience!  Please direct questions to #freenode as staff are a little swamped!
 GET OFF COD!!
 :D
 i just did

 I've done it for the second time now ;)
 Oh well, looks like I can't be doing any spectating :(

 Hey
 Ed, been on holiday?  You've been absent for a while I think :p
 hey Ben
 :O ITS ED!
 Only 3 days :P
 Thanks :(
 Sorry Ben, I haven't seen Ed for a while.
 Haha some guy worse a horse mask to the pub yesterday http://grab.by/dWz  I want one :(
 Heh
 Did I miss much?
 Nope
 alex, maybe he secretly got married and went on honeymoon?
 poor ben
 :(
 3 days seems like a lifetime when it comes to you, Ed ...
 hello
 Haha, nice to know I was missed Dave :P
 :D
 Been having fun?
 Was it a holiday... or business trip? :p
 Not really either, just busy days. A lot of my friends work within education, so they get a half term :P
 That's my plan ;)
 Good plan ;)
 Yesterday was fun, round my friends, aim was to scare the trick or treaters we made 3 kids cry... and some teenagers scream their heads off. Friend, got in his car on the drive and waited for them to come up the path, jumped up, turned engine on and screamed at them :P
 LOL haha nice!!
 Before I went to my parties, had the old hose pipe in the letter box ;)
 What did you dress up as Ed ?
 Hah, did it work? Well it was a bit rushed, so it was just a sheet with eye holes :P. Not sure if they were scared by me looking like a ghost or a kkk member ;)
 What did you go as?
 haha nice and origional I see ;)
 Yeh it worked, especially on some chavs who thought it would be funny to throw and egg at the door!
 lmfao
 I went to my first party as a pink powerpuff girl and the second one as Dracular
 poor england and it's chavs.
 Chavs ftw ;)
 ^^^
 My outfit cost me £7 from Primark (Y)
 O.o :p
 A pink powerpuff girl, I can see the fear factor in that :P
 haha, says the person who had a sheet over his head ;)
 Gotta vacuum bbs
 No I mean, that is scary, a guy as a powerpuff girl
 Ben is finally coming out for Dave ;)
 oh lol ;)
 Yeh my other friends were the green and blue ones
 Gays.
 So you had a good time then Ed ? :)
 Brandon... ?

 He looks scary :O

 Got a bet on for this Newcastle match today?  I'm very much hoping for a Sheffield Utd win, just so I can poke fun at geordi housemate
 Alex, yes reason why I am trying to load up the website.
 To post about it. Mind you this is only corner betting.
 hi
 i am bored
 Testing out some new system / research.
 Hello Drazilaustin
 anything interesting
 whats the topic
 well i got someone interested in zymic the other day
 he too thinks zymic the the best web host ever
 i think i may try uploading a smf forum later today.
 anyone have any advice
 Why SMF/
 PHPBB?
 i have grown attatched to it
 I see
 i use it all the time on my friends smf forums
 Well, no advice other than you can not use the mail() function so be sure to disable email activation.
 i know
 the forums my friend started are pritty popular.
 I see
 it already has 63 users and it is invitations only
 it also has 22682 posts
 i think
 Lots of posts between a small number of people
 but there is a bug or something
 every now and then there is an accout curruption of some sort
 the admin has to shut down the site to fix it.
 happened a few times
 so anything good to talk about
 anyone have a site i could look at
 Nope boring day
 hmm
 still i wouldnt mind checking out a few sites
 i know
 hola people
 i have a question i have been wondering
 how exactly do you put a video on a web page
 the object tag is the only html tag i have gotten compleatly lost on
 The typical way at the moment is to embed a flash player
 HTML5 brings a <video> tag with it, but that's not for some years yet (though it's implemented in a few browsers already)
 And it remains to be seen how interoperable that is after Apple screwed Ogg Theora out of being the standard video codec
 sorry
 the idiot next to me restarted my computer instead of his computer
 Want me to repeat what I said then, or did you get it?  (three lines)
 but now i am back
 no i didnt
 [16:21:21] <Alex> The typical way at the moment is to embed a flash player
 [16:21:40] <Alex> HTML5 brings a <video> tag with it, but that's not for some years yet (though it's implemented in a few browsers already)
 [16:22:00] <Alex> And it remains to be seen how interoperable that is after Apple screwed Ogg Theora out of being the standard video codec
 hmm
 could you give me an example
 i am a quick learner
 but i need a good example to learn off of
 and hi ed
 Hello
 anything new with you
 Not that hard to find working examples with google: http://www.w3schools.com/flash/flash_inhtml.asp for example
 hmm.
 what about on zymic
 will this code work on zymic
 You can use that for video files, and a lot of browsers will have handlers which attempt to stream the media, but generally you get a cross-browser consistent page by transcoding the video to SWF
 I can't think of a reason why it won't work on Zymic
 so what file type should i save the videos as
 You want a .swf
 and how do i make it .swf
 Find some software that can transcode it
 hmm
 I know of a few on Linux
 is there something you would recomend
 Not really, but I can give a few that run on Linux as I said
 Other platforms, I have no idea at all
 hmm. ok
 does anyone else have any suggestions
 out of curiosity why doesnt the irc work on IE
 Huh?  You mean mibbit?
 i guess
 We aren't responsible for mibbit, ask them if there are browser support issues
 ok
 i was just wondering if anyone knew
 it works on fire fox though
 oh i remember my other question now
 on the forums they have a way to check a persons ip. how does that work exactly
 Log the IP address of the member, job done.
 how
 i never could find out how it was done
 When people make a request there are certain superglobals populated with information associated with that request
 also what language is it done in
 For example <?php echo $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']; ?> is a very short PHP snippet which takes REMOTE_ADDR (remote address) from the $_SERVER superglobal
 This contains the IP address of the person who requested the page
 cool
 It can be done in any server-side language, but that's PHP
 i am good with php
 dont know any other server languages
 Sure you are, so good you haven't come across $_SERVER before :p
 well i am self tought
 Why are people always insisting on boasting about things that aren't even true
 i am not an expert but i am pritty good with using it
 thats why i said good
 Ok, so, what's the benefit of using object-oriented programming in your software design?
 That's a trivial, and fairly fundamental thing :p
 ffs its waaaaaaaaay too cold to go outside D:
 g2g to lunch
 Hah, thought so
 I don't mind people who're new to programming, but when they start believing they know everything they need to be put down a bit ;)
 lol

 no sup?
 :/
 Why are you trying to initiate a conversation in the first place, we've been over this before
 I have no interest in reconciling
 And you're only going to upset yourself if you keep trying
 hi
 i am back
 anything new
 Excellent, got an answer to that easy question about OOP concepts?
 I just wanted to confirm that since you're good at PHP, you'd obviously know these fundamentals
 ???
 what
 [16:42:08] <Alex> Ok, so, what's the benefit of using object-oriented programming in your software design?
 what is the topic
 I asked that just before you left, to confirm that you know your stuff
 i know enough to make a mazemaker site
 http://mazemaker.vndv.com/index.php
 i see you didnt take the feedback i gave you....
 color scheme is horrid
 oh yeah
 On the design side it also needs some padding/margins
 well like i said all i have is paint
 eww
 yes i still have the same site.
 Can't you get either GIMP or Paint.NET, I think both of those are free
 maybe.
 but the tables take up several files
 pictures
 The HTML needs a lot of work, it's pretty nasty
 i have 50 files for mazemaker and at least half of them are pictures
 tables :D
 :O**
 Yeah, and tables for things that aren't tabular data.
 i set it up so that no mkatter how big the table is the image will look the same
 I mean, using <table> to lay out that login form is pretty bad
 well i kinda copied that form
 But not as bad as things like the fact the HTML source has no logical structure at all :P
 No indentation
 i got that one too
 hey if you want to get on me about my php i can make you an admin
 i am self tought so if i am bad it is cause no one told me otherwise
 As far as the design and HTML go, I'd scrap and start again, you can do better.
 That is a point, and this is why you shouldn't learn from random code on the internet
 Because you end up learning it wrongly
 well it works
 "It works" is not really something most people can get away with
 Certainly you'll find that a pain to maintain if it comes to it
 i guess
 gives me something to do
 do you have an account
 And please don't start offering coding services to others, because a lot of people who actually have little understanding do that :p
 yeah
 i know
 I get quite annoyed when someone comes on here asking for help for trivial things and it turns out they're charging someone else for this hash.
 i kinda focus on php
 well maybe you should broaden your focus ?
 html. i just learn what i need
 You haven't learned any of the stuff you really need
 maybe
 I can tell that by looking at one page :p
 hmm
 is the design that bad
 I mean, you've made a mistake at line 1
 i did?
 no doctype
 (lack of a doctype by the way)
 i never understood what that was for
 And you should also have a <meta> tag which specifies the content encoding
 The doctype informs the browser how it should render the page
 For example, I use HTML4.01 Strict
 what type do i want to put in there
 Drazilaustin: http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http://mazemaker.vndv.com/index.php
 That means the browser will render my site in standards compliance mode
 Whereas, yours, since it lacks a doctype will be thrown into the quirks mode tag soup engine
 hmm
 maybe i need to work on it.
 this is helpfull
 wana look at the php
 Wait a minute, there's plenty more in the HTML first ;)
 lol ok
 You have a stylesheet embedded into the HTML, that's a midly bad thing
 hmm
 yeah
 You should really have a separate file for the stylesheet, in which case the browser will cache it
 And you save a lot of repeated CSS being sent to everyone who views it, extra bandwidth that's proportional to the number of HTML page requests
 if my html is this bad how bad do you think my php is
 As I said before, you shouldn't be using tables for that login form, I'll go into more detail on why that is now
 HTML when written properly has a concept of semantic markup
 That is, the HTML should use tags that describe the content they hold, so <p> should be used for paragraphs, <h1> should be used for the highest level header etc
 And tables should be used for tabular data
 i guess i can remove the table
 but..
 is there a way to keep it looking like that without a table
 Why do you /want/ it to look like that?  Default tables are not a good look
 ]at least a border and aqua background (till i change it
 i AM thinking of adding images
 to make it look better
 whats next
 Anyways, yes you could make it look the same, but I'm not going to get into how because that's not really on-topic
 the aqua background is nasty
 I mentioned a lack of indentation, and that's one of the biggest faults
 how does that affect it
 You should have a consistent indentation system so that the code has some logical structure that makes it easy to visually see what tags are children of which other tags
 ah
 It makes altering and maintaining the code once you've written it roughly 6000 times easier
 Roughly speaking
 i think me php is bad too
 There's always a way to improve someones script
 lol
 no matter how good YOU think it is, someone will find a way to make it better
 http://pastesite.com/ <-- check out the source for that, Drazilaustin
 I use three-space indentation
 And you'll note, you can easily see which tags are inside other tags
 i know
 this was the first real site i ever worked on
 and first big project blah blah blah
 I'm not expecting it to be perfect, I'm just hoping for a bit more humility ;)
 ok
 People who say they're already quite good at something tend to not want to take constructive criticism
 Alex: alexperry design #4,391 - http://www.aperry.net/dark.jpg
 wana look at the php now
 And it smacks a bit of arrogance, but that's me ;)
 Criticisms?
 No, assuming you're categorically pretty damn good at something :p
 Hm?
 Oh, right sorry, crossed conversations
 Hah thats what I though :P no big deal
 I'm not sure I like that floating radial gradient, the navigation seems a bit too blocky for my taste
 I think the logo could have some more contrast, perhaps a lighter shade of blue?
 Alright, yeah that blue is a bit difficult to interpret against the black background
 The "Go to my contact information" bar I think doesn't quite fit vertically
 "contact me" sticks to the right of it
 ...
 I think that's what makes it look a little odd
 Other than that, it's fine, Perry :p
 You mean the text on the button?
 alex whats your username on my site
 Thank you, Alex, will fix your suggestions.
 Drazilaustin: I don't have one, pick a decent size file and put it on pastesite.com (you can set a password if you want to keep it a bit private)
 I should be able to get a feel from anything that's over a few hundred lines
 i have a page that lets you view the source of my pages with php but it is for admins only'
 Yeah, I'd just rather not make an account if it's all the same to you :p
 so you can just register an account and have access to all my pages with passwords edited out
 hmm
 could i make you one
 I suppose, but I would rather just view some source :p
 ok
 your username is alex
 and should i pm you the password
 A notice would be better, but PM is ok
 notice?
 lol
 /notice username text
  /noticealex like this?
 or is there a space
 Well, yeah, but without the space before the / and with one after "notice" :p
 ok 
 Yes, that worked
 http://xkcd.com/657/large/
 Awesome idea
 I saw that, it is interesting, Robert
 after that
 But well, lacking in the humour I was hoping for :p
 I don't go to xkcd to be informed, that's what xkcd's blag is for! ;)
 now login
 i just made you an admin
 on the acp page there is a link to a page where you can view the files source
 A tip, for your fileview page
 yes
 PHP has a function which outputs highlighted PHP source
 hmm
 what is that function
 Just creating a .phps highlights it, doesnt it?
 If you've got the right handler set up, yes, but I wouldn't recommend putting .phps files onto a production system, Perry :p
 http://uk.php.net/manual/en/function.highlight-string.php
 Lol no I know :P
 AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps # it requires that in apache config
 ok...
 But if that's there then .phps does what you describe
 i always get confues on that site
 By the way, that stuff about apache, I wasn't talking to you there, Drazilaustin :p
 You don't need to do anything to apache
 ok
 http://uk.php.net/manual/en/function.highlight-file.php would actually be easier really
 I should have linked that one
 you did
 or not
 If you use that function
 want me to add it
 You don't need $var = file_get_contents(...);
 Or $value = ...
 Just those two echos
 i edit out passwords before displaying it
 Ah, sorry, good point you do need that, so keep those
 lol
 And make htmlspecialchars()
 Into highlight_string($value,true)
 let me do it now
 Ah, because it's HTML output, you want to remove the <pre> tags
 it worked
 And then it'll be perfect
 that worked too
 wana check out the index page now
 and also is my php at least a little better than my html
 When you're redirecting someone to a page like sitedown.php
 You should really explicitly state that you don't want to process the page any more after the header call
 Because it makes no sense to continue in that case
 I would have an exit; after that header() call, within that if
 ???
 how do i do that
 Well, you see on the index that there's header('Location: ...');
 In those cases, I would do:
 header('Location: ...'); exit;
 what does exit do exactly
 Ends execution, stops the script there, since it's stopping just after a redirect, it doesn't affect how it functions at all
 It just ensures that execution stops when it should
 and if i dont exicute the header function?
 will the exit not do anything
 Then the exit is never reached, because the exit is only reached when the header call is
 It's synonymous with die()
 ok
 Ok, another thing, you seem to have absolutely no templating at all
 ???
 So, in your index.php you have the whole stylesheet, and all of the <head> twice
 In general, any time you write the same thing twice, that's a bad thing
 Within reason obviously
 hmm.
 i was planning to fix that
 but yeah i get the idea
 The obvious solution here is to have something like header.inc, or header.php or header.tpl, matter of taste which extension you want
 And you include that when you want to output the header
 Means that all the header code is in one place, and editing it once edits it everywhere
 Makes it a lot easier to maintain the site
 ok
 i will fix that
 what about my other pages
 like play.php and new.php
 I hope I never have to maintain code like play.php :p
 lol
 is it good or bad
 Bad
 how bad
 1 to 10
 That's pretty awful, loads of random operations on variables that have no obvious meaning
 10 being the worst
 7, just because it's quite short.  If it was longer we'd be looking at 8 or 9 ;)
 well they do have meaning
 To anyone but you?
 they are for checking the variabls based on your location
 and what direction your facing
 The thing is, you've defined 10 variables, all of which have identifiers no longer than two characters
 And since I am not psychic
 I can't tell what you meant by $ft
 This is a good example of how you can write code in such a way that anyone else looking at it will have to spend 30-60 minutes decoding what all the variable names mean before they can do anything useful
 It's not good practice ;)
 i can
 i know what they mean
 You know, because you wrote it
 But no one else does, and in 6 months will you remember?
 Perhaps
 for the first letter f is front ans s is side
 yes
 second letters
 Confidence, often misplaced in this case :p
 You'll find people quite often think "Oh, I'll remember what that meant, won't bother to comment it"
 t is top l is left r is right and b is bottom
 And then come back to find as it turns out, they were wrong :p
 so this way i can keep track of wich way i face in the maze
 actualy
 i made an explination for my friend for how the page works'
 When you're writing code in such a cryptic procedural fashion
 Best to have comments throughout
 http://pastesite.com/11436 this should help explain it
 I like how you've decided to be helpful by having it as (y,x) pairs :p
 When cartesian coordinates work on (x,y)
 yeah.
 my bad
 i started that way and that is how the variabls were set up in the database
 I also like how they're described as cordinets, but that's a different line of criticism altogether ;)
 it is a little too late to change it without a lot of effort
 "variabls" makes a fair few appearances too ;)
 But moving on
 new.php is a hardcoded nuisance of a page
 yes it is
 Had you generated the page dynamically, it would be about 20 times shorter
 Some loops are all that's really needed to make that bearable :p
 i had to make it so that it would change td colors depending on weter it was checked or not
 *wether
 whether*
 But yeah, that could all be in some loop logic
 -__- i am a bad speller
 I don't see that you need to enumerate every case
 And by doing so you greatly limit flexibility
 it is a wonder you havnt gotten on me for spelling my tags wrong
 well try out the page. when you click preiview on the page it changes the colors of each cell
 this limits confusion on the page wich there was plenty of when i first made it
 I don't see why this is a problem, you could do that within a loop as well
 hmm
 maybe
 probably right
 but it is also a little late now for that
 hmm
 not as late as the (y,x) thing though
 get in line
 lol... mine is just one item... not an entire overhaul of a website ;)
 lol
 sorry
 i was jk
 but i am laving soon
 to goto class
 eh i gotta go to work either way
 so i have only a few minutes left anyway
 I could, if you said what you want advice on :p
 lol everyone wants your advice today, eh Alex?
 oh the reson i was so insistent on using the fileview page instead of pastesite is because if i serch for my site on google it seems my old pastesites posts come up before the real site and come first in the list
 well it helps pass the time
 yay
 our talk takes up the whole page
 Drazilaustin: if you get the time, after you've done the little things, work on cleaning up the indentation of all the code
 ok
 i have gotten better
 this was my first php project
 i recently did one where i indented
 i g2g. i will be on later
 maybe
 but i will definetly be on tomorrow about the same timke
 *time
 bye
 More dirty toilets to clean tomorrow aye Drazilaustin
 Perry: what can I say, I'm a popular guy
 Haha I guess :P Did you ever, as a little kid, think you would be so popular in zIRC?
 Oh of course
 It's always been one of my main goals
 Yeah, that's what i had figured.
 this is Alex's life, if anything were to happen to zIRC, 
 who knows what would happen to him..
 lol
 harsh
 ;)
 everyone wants to be popula
 r
 except me, i want people to leave me alone
 lol
 i dont mind helping people when I can.
 Because I know what its like wanting help and people not wanting to offer it
 the people I don't like are the ones who know a lot about what you're trying to learn about, but don't want to help you because you don't know what you're doing
 Yep.
 YEah
 Perry: don't buy anymore
 Why? :(
 I love them Pie`
 because smoking tobacco is for faggots ;)
 :O
 I know :/
 Anyone have a Blackberry Bold?
 my mum does
 How is it?
 its good
 Good. Mine will be here on weds
 Anything bad about it?
 I've never used it
 and my mother never does anything more than text/phone/email people on it
 so she's never really put it through its paces
 Ah
 Anything is better than WM 6
 My house is now in high definition on Google Earth
 I have no idea why - I'm in the middle of nowhere!
 on Google Earth or maps?
 they figured out a dangerous person lives there... and they wanna keep an eye on him... :P
 lol
 high definition?
 Earth
 There used to be (and probably still is) 2 levels of resolution
 My house used to be low res
 Now it's high
 im high, too.
 No talking about drugs in this channel please Perry

 Alex, you there? I'm not sure how to manage domains via bash, Google isn't returning anything useful
 What do you mean?
 Add, delete, etc.
 subdomains ect?
 What server software do you have?
 No, like... addon domains!
 What do you mean?
 e.g, apache
 http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/vhosts/name-based.html
 I cannot edit httpd.conf, I'm using Brandons server
 I would use cPanel but its having troubles with his license
 one of my cats thought it would be a GREAT idea to beat up a pencil... rofl
 TheOracle: I had a problem adding new domains while i was using brandon
 never did manage to solve it :(

 You've just reminded me of one of a thing that was funny in my past.
 Brandon you didn't tell me that the server wasn't supposed to be up anymore :(
 Wut?
 It's still up? http://threedicedrop.com
 Robert told me that that server was supposed to be gone by now.
 I has
 It*
 I was like 7 and I dropped a box of pins on my dad side of the bed.. when he got up he wasn't happy.. was  pulling out 30 pins out of his feet. Lol.
 o_O
 :)
 Why, TheOracle?
 You have just contradicted yourself
 How so..?
 <Brandon>It's still up? http://threedicedrop.com -> Server is working
 It is..
 <TheOracle>Robert told me that that server was supposed to be gone by now.
 <Brandon>I has
 <Brandon>It* -> Server isn't working
 It's up...
 I'm off to eat

 How's everyone been anyway?
 I'm fine, thank you :). Yourself, Adam?
 That's good :) I'm great thanks, how's owl sBot doing? :)
 Good stuff.
 sBot? Are you really going to ask a bot how he it? ;)
 Yes, he was a dear friend.
 Greg's sexy.
 He's sick
 I'm not sure how
 Swine Flu?
 Occassionally he decides to snub us, and doesn't come back until I go and get him

 Oh, yes.. that's possible. He did just come back from Mexico... so....
 I'm not sure why
 nn Zymic
 Night Pie`
 Now I can play COD4? ;)
 hi
 Do you need help with anything?
 so anything new
 You know, there might well be people here and there might not
 hmm
 Either way saying "helloooo?" and variants over and over is not helpful
 i dodnt know tha
 Get some damn patience
 that*
 i am
 Though, to be fair you're not the worst example
 i was just bored
 We get this a lot with people who don't even wait one minute
 lol
 lol
 And start shouting hello over and over for about a minut
 minute*
 And then they quit
 lol
 Alex, you very well know that we all do that once in a while
 spam masters
 Speak for yourself, Sazzad :p
 I do that when pyDelphi doesn't make me tea
 %tea
 Damn you!

 How is that related to what I was talking about
 internet tea tasts terable
 Drazilaustin: There is a bot on this chat line that makes us tea.
 Unless we go all the way back to just being generally annoying
 ????
 wait
 a computer was just brought into being
 i am back
 someone built a sweet computer
 %tea
 i wanted to see it.
 pyDelphi :(
 %tea please pypy
 ;]
 i took a picture of it
 thnx pypy my good botfriend

 -_______________________-
 -___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________-
 ok
 i wont have tea

 lol
 soda is bad for your teeth
 ^
 -____-
 but it tasts good
 thats the thing about unhealthy food
 90% of the time they taste way better :(
 i know
 i am in nutrition this 9 weeks at school
 that was covered
 buti stillwant soda
 %soda
 didnt work
 why doesnt the bot serve soda
 i want soda
 so anything new
 ........................
 Drazilaustin: you talk too much
 maybe
 i guess i do
 but only when the topic is ether boring or interesting
 if it is anywhere in the middle iam quiet
 holy jesus
 i just completed beginner level minesweeper for the first time in my life :o
 lol
 still iama little bored
 anyone know a good flash game
 or something
 i cant watch youtube because the schools filter has blocked all the proxys
 Since it's getting towards Christmas... :p
 http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/g3/bells.htm
 Well, according to adverts it has been Christmas for months now
 bloces
 blocked
 woops i spelled that one compleatly wrong
 awesome :D
 completely* :)
 Has that guy with the controllable web cam put his xmas lights up yet?
 yeah
 That is an addictive game though, the thing to try is to see if you can get a score large enough that it doesn't fit in the score box thing
 DAVE
 Which is doable since getting the birds is a 2x score multiplier
 i could do line rider
 but it is no fun unless you have access to hypercam to record it
 whats the point in making a track if you cant record it
 i do have some line rider videos already on youtube
 but i cantwatch youtube
 but here is my channel anyway
 http://www.youtube.com/user/drazil100
 *sigh*
 Hey JACK
 Happy Birthday Alex :) having a fun day??
 hi dave
 hey

 my friend was a facebook page for halloween
 ...
 ok
 did anyone dress up as a youtube page
 ...
 sorry
 yay lunch
 see ya in 30 mins
 Cheers, Dave.  To be honest, no
 I have an uncanny knack for being unwell on these sorts of day
 Cold/flu thing has meant I haven't slept for four days, and that's brought my migraines back on :p
 So all in all it's going well
 Oh no :(
 That's a good bit of bad luck
 Happy bday lil man
 Heh, after christmas, and then new years, it's par for the course :
 :p*
 I'll be 24 in a couple months :(
 gettingo ld
 Still, no huge deal, I can't say I was that hyped up about this birthday anyway
 I'm getting a bit bored of them :p
 Lol
 bdays get more boring the older ya get...
 Ow
 My hands hurt
 A lot
 they are a bit lame after 18
 it's more just a chance to see lots of people all on one night
 yup
 which is nice :)
 i'll just end up going out, getting smashed the night before.
 miss my birthday as i spend it in bed recovering.
 alls good
 bringon Jan!
 lol
 Robert: RSI maybe?  You should probably check
 No, too much ringing
 I get cramps in my right leg when I have a migraine these days, which is very odd.
 nearly 4 hours on the end of a rope in the last 2 days
 No serious blisters
 But nearly!
 Ah, yeah, so it's a sort of sore ache kind of thing?
 Yep
 %tea please pypy
 Damn!
 %tea please pypy
 Dolleh did Oracle change the original commnad?
 sometimes commands dont work for the owner... figured id try it for ya ;)
 er wait
 It only works for Dolleh
 It was made this way, because you lot can't be trusted to not spam it
 It worked for me 2 days ago
 You get about four people triggering the exact same messages
 12 lines of useless garbage in channel
 heh
 Anyways, after one of the cases where that happened, I mentioned it was quite spammy, and TO altered it
 %tea pyp :D
 thnx pypy ;)
 Frankly, I don't really like it existing at all, why does it have to be three lines?
 But provided it's at least rarely called...
 happy b-day sir alex :P
 Cheers
 It's all in Dolleh's hands then... 
 Dangerous!! :p
 >D
 now alex officially belongs to the old zymic guys, like ed and greg, awww
 :/
 and jack
 the golden oldies club

 woo
 What about you, Dave?
 You must be, or will be this academic year
 I'm not quite there yet thank you ;)
 Also, Robert is older than me too :p
 I'm beaten by Trice and Ed
 anyone want to help me look for a new color for mazemaker
 Drazilaustin: http://www.colourlovers.com/
 Specifically "palettes"
 i was thinkingkeeping what i have but changing the color
 http://www.colourlovers.com/palettes/top starting from there will generally find you something that looks good
 like to a darker blue
 Drazilaustin: well... that wouldn't be a sensible way of going about it, people use colour palettes for a reason :p
 can someone give me, or provide the paypal address to pay for php mail ?
 someone in #hosting wants it enabled
 Because all the colours gel well with each other, and you get a nice easy on the eye design
 bread@zymic.com
 thanks
 Drazilaustin: so, really, given the colour scheme you've got now, I definitely recommend replacing all of the colours, find a nice colour scheme and redo it all
 It'll give you a better result
 well i was thinking what i got is good but to bright and anoying
 lol yea man... it literrally HURT my eyes when you first showed me it
 i was thinking a color like this  5F7BA1 (hex number)
 That's certainly a reason why the colour scheme you had was bad
 But if you just start randomly replacing colours, you're not going to get as good a result
 I'm not going to change my recommendation :p
 ok
 but can you tell me if the table border colors were at least ok
 http://mazemaker.vndv.com/index.php
 I wouldn't keep any of it :p
 hmm
 ok
 not even the background style
 The squares?  Definitely not, they're too bulky, too aqua, and too 90s ;)
 but i do want to keep the table style
 with work the pics could look good
 it would take way too much work to start that over
 i suggested completely re-doing the site
 i just need new colors for the pictuers
 aw man
 those boxes and colors really make it hard on the eyes
 it took me a month to make just this
 the maze itself is a pretty cool concept... but the design is dragging it down
 ok
 does anyone want to help me re do it
 aww crap
 i just found someone registered a domain name i was going to register
 should i shut down the site for now
 nah
 id say create a new folder
 hmm
 i guess
 and re-do the entire website in that folder... when its finished, just move it to the root
 ok
 on second thought i think i will keep the table style (not colors) it took me a while to make this table look the way i wanted it to.
 i will just recolor it the colors of my new style
 lets see what else do i need to do
 Dolleh pics
 :O
 sodoes anyone want to help with design?
 i am open to new ideas
 ^ I win, Dolleh ;)
 ahw boo @ you dave

 looks gay
 ;)
 shopping makes me happy, Dolleh ;)

 2009 Lexus IS-F
 i think i knowa way to make the background look better now
 i will work on it when i get home
 Go for a more moden look Drazilaustin
 uh
 Perry: did you crash your lexus into halfords?
 well i want to try 1 thing with my current style first
 What Pie`?
 i might have a way to save it
 maybe
 the bodykit on it looks ridiculous ;)
 just newcolors
 Nah its just the angle of that picture
  to be honest when i look at it
 The rear bumber in that picture looks huge :P
  i see a grid
 no Perry, its just a shit bodykit
 But its really not
 NO
 like a waffle
 i just need a less annying color and better shading to make it look more like a grid
 maybe not as buisy
 so fainter
 it might work
 and i cant see it hurting the eyes
 but i dont got paint
 not on this computer
 i checked
 hey i just checked with my classmates
 they gave me an idea for the color
 they also said that the blocks were ok
 all i need to fix is the color
 how do you use hexidecimal color values on a website
 i forget
 i want to test a color
 Hi

 Cheers, Ed :)

 look who wake up, ed lazy ass
 woke up*
 btw Ed ... i got someone to enable php mail for $10... i expect a refer bonus... cookies plz?
 Urla: Have you tried live support by clicking "Live support online"?
 watch out jaxm, ed can't bake cookies, their horrible!
 :O
 Nice Dolleh! 
 dammit
 where ? give me link
 so 450 euros translates to like... $5
 can get some mcdonalds i suppose
 Heh, what dollar is this?
 Sorry to say, but you're a relatively weak currency compared to Euro and GBP
 haha yea
 Urla: Log into your vpn control panel and you'll find a link there on the left hand side
 probs jaxm monies, not worth much?
 arghhjhhhhh
 lost my contract for Aion
 dammit
 i cant really compete when a fecking corporate network rolls in and sets up exactly what i was going to do
 well shit
 that just ruined my day
 im gonna go cry and slit my wrists in a dark corner listening to linkin park
 cyas

 i found a new color pattern
 new theme
 but you will have to wait and see
 *smiles*
 So, I hear there's now a £1,002 train ticket going :p
 Why could they not have invested the level of money they are now that it's privitised back when it was public
 Where's it going? :P
 It's a first class return from cornwall to scotland
 But it's a bit ridiculous, £501 each way?
 And I thought I was ripped off when I had to buy a £50 single London->Swindon once :p
 it's first class, Alex
 and yet only a third of the journey is on trains with first class facilities !
 WOWWWWWWW

 nvm
 nn
 Don't forget to kiss your mother good night Jack2
 hi
 is anyone on
 hey all
 ok i am finaly ready to update my style for the site. wish me luck.
 Woo
 i have a question
 hey TO
 how do you delete an image catch or whatever they are called
 the thing that makes it look the same\
 even when it changes
 i am working on my site and i am swaping images
 ctrl + F5 on most browsers
 http://bash.org/?8735
 Haha
 Only a mathematician will find it REALLY funny though
 *nerd
 No, I'm going to stick to mathematician
 I'm sure there are plenty of nerds who won't understand it fully
 haha I get most of it Robert
 And the big punchline is?
 by i he means a pronoun not a variable
 last sentince 
 didn't get the math stuff though
 No, the punchline is in the maths stuff
 I got it wrong then
 Google 'integrate ln(x) from 0 to infinity'
 You can't
 It's undefined
 aha
 well do you belive in god ?
 No
 well if god is capable of anything can he calculate 2+2 = 666 and still get a correct answer ?
 :P
 No
 night night all
 Good night Dave
 Robert, can you help me?
 or if god is capable of doing everything can he create a rock that he can't left ? if so, he can't left -> he is not capable of everything, if not, then also, he is not capable of doing everything
 rebel, you cant temp the Lord our God
 I'm afraid I don't think we should get into these sort of discussions
 Thar be Dragons
 i never heard the sBot speak before. 
 well they shouldn't mean anything, they are not a proof against god because you can't just say god is not true building on some lingual trick 
 after you won't need these to say god doesn't exists
 exist *
 what do you mean by Temp Darius ? sorry not a native speaker....
 i think he means tempt
 Im meaning, you sound like satan trying to temp Jesus. satan told Jesus todo things, but Jesus didnt
 well I agree, I can't temp God, simply because he doesn't exist
 Yeah, seems like he does mean tempt, he's just still writing temp :p
 Does anyone else here see an inevitable flame war here?
 -here
 Oh of course, usually is
 well it shouldn't be a war unless someone declares it as that
 But who doesn't like the odd little one ;)
 rebel, you dont believe because you are condemn. He that believe in the son isnt condemn, but he that doesnt is already condemn because he dont believe in the name of the only beloved son of God
 Sure, til its not so little Alex
 Bearing in mind it's not too difficult to put the brakes on
 Darius: keep in mind that I'm an ex-muslim
 I tried to pre-empt it
 But apparently I'm being ignore
 ignored*
 I am a christian
 who know God is real
 who thinks he knows ?
 I haven't a clue.
 Darius: perhaps you mean condemned?  And in that case are people who are raised without knowledge of the christian faith condemned because they don't follow it?
 when you all hear about the United Nations making a one world leader, you should believe in Christ, before its to late
 What does the UN have to do with that?
 Alex, if you are raise in Christ, you arent condemn, but if you raise with lack of faith in him is
 I just downloaded 7zip off a website and it came in a .rar lol
 Alex, the book of revelation states that there will be a man who will reign for 7 years
 the UN worships Jesus, Alex. don't try to deny it
 he shall be loved by many people, but he is a deciever
 lol Benpadgett 
 Oh yeah, I forgot how all the UN meetings start with a prayer
 Alex
 And the UN has little power to actually govern states, they're a coalition body
 Darius: let me guess, that's the pope ?
 As such they're limited in how they can act
 im not catholic, so the pope can just goto hell
 :|
 Alex, the antichrist have to gain many trust first before taking good actions that can help millions
 no I meant the deciever 
 The UN is not really a stepping stone to world domination...
 And I personally find the idea of the UN taking over somewhat laughable :p
 also not respecting others beleaves can get you killed Darius.
 rebel, im not afraid of death
 he that has fear is in death
 because perfct love cast out fear, for fear torment in love
 perfect
 Bleh
 I'm incredibly bored.
 Nice website Alex
 Darius: I think you devoloped a 2 thousend years methology so you just can say that : I'm not afraid of death
 Hmmm?  Which one, Benpadgett?
 rebel, are you afraid of death
 alex-elliott.co.uk
 Ah, that one, that's not done :p
 because you know you wont have anwhere to go after you die, other than being put into the ground
 Darius: since I belive in life before death, no, I don't.
 but God is real
 I need to get around to finishing that at some point
 which ones good
 i like the layout of alex-elliot.co.uk
 lol
 Ah, well, the design I have Adam to thank for
 As it says in the footer
 But yeah, I like it too :p
 Adam?
 Oh, your portfolio ;)
 Whos Adam? A web designer
 Darius: can you prove God ? just answer yes or no plz.
 Benpadgett: He is awesome; http://wized.net ;)
 My portfolio is not a design portfolio, so there's no conflict of interest there ;)
 yes
 but can you
 Is York uni any good Alex?
 can I what ? lol
 prove that God isnt real?
 Yes, definitely, of course it depends what kind of course you want
 I thought you were talking about Pastesite as Andy did that design, didn't he? :)
 Hmm
 Yeah, andy did pastesite
 Darius: why should I ?
 This DanActive stuff is tasty
 because I want o hear your answer
 and its a yes or no question
 Pastesite is very useful
 The CS department is good, Benpadgett.  Top 10 in the country by rankings, and I would place it higher
 can you prove Allah doesn't exist Darius ?
 What are good it courses to take at uni.
 Well... where do you see yourself working after the course?
 In IT
 Yes
 can you prove the other 230473247238574895748957 competing Gods and Godesses don't exist ?
 Or would you go into research?
 yep
 I can prove it
 but can you
 Einstein couldn't though
 ?? Dont know just wondering i like IT though.
 prove that one God doesnt exist
 will I couldn't prove they don't except Jesus
 thats my question and you havent answer it one bit
 Well, it's hard to really specify too much without some more information
 you have to believe me on this
 Jesus is Lord
 believe Darius BELIEVE
 http://www.dailyawesome.com/images/atheists1.jpg
 you're a believer right ?
 ill just leave this here
 How long have you gone to uni now Alex
 Jesus died on that cross for us
 This is my second year, Benpadgett
 he that believe in him that died and rose from the dead is saved
 What do you study
 I'm doing a Masters of Engineering in Computer Systems and Software Engineering
 Which is part of the Computer Science department at York
 Is it very hard? Or do you find it easy
 Darius: since english in not my mother language, this person here --> http://Jhuger.com is more capable of saying what I wanna say , just give his site a visit
 Some parts don't come easily, I'm not interested that much in the low-level hardware stuff, and that can be troublesome
 But I'm fine with the maths, and find the programming strands pretty intuitive
 rebel, the whole point is that Jesus died for us, so that in him, we may be the cleanse from all sin
 this is the page you wanna visit Darius : http://www.jhuger.com/mystic_atheism
 NO REBEL!
 lol
 Is that area of IT got good pay?
 Another person doing it again now; http://grabup.crownstyles.com/f268a92c2b74701e67621af07610d93f.png >.<
 Software Engineering?  Yeah, it pays pretty well, it's a skilled job
 What Brandon?
 Not something you could get a random cut-price Indian outsource company to do :p
 More than average. Which is Â£37000
 Which is where a lot of the lower level programming stuff goes
 Darius: you might forgot, but I'm still an ex-muslim,,, so this "Jesus died for us" kind of shit usually doesn't work with me
 LOL
 Way, rebel you did it :); http://grabup.crownstyles.com/bcfc76ac9478ed2759ec1becf75ef927.png
 Brandon ?
 wat?
 I don't get it ?
 Brandon is talking about comma placement.
 Ah
 what about it ?
 But is being completely disingenuous about it :p
 stuff, stuff 
 ^ right ?
 "word , word" versus "word, word"
 See , he know ' s what i ' m going on about
 he being ' alex '
 wtfs an alex
 MS word corrects stuff , stuff into stuff, stuuf
 stuff*
 go try it
 No one was advocating "word , word"
 In that case - http://grab.by/eyq
 :P
 And there wasn't doubt expressed over which way is correct :p
 this is so stupid
 ,,, certainly isn't correct however
 :3
 im back
 What's stupid, DarkKrai?
 No you're not.
 comma placement
 well since I'm not in an exam nor that I'm writing a book or something like that, then I'll just be concerned about my point reaching others
 my keys... are sticking, I need a new keyboard
 stupid green tea spill :(
 rebel: no one asked :p
 rebel, you will see soon, thats all im going to say
 end of discussion
 I know, I just was confirming it
 1/5/10
 Pie` ?
 ?
 Brb, cod
 Having a break Brandon? Don't forget your kit kat
 I have one!
 Darius: I won't see soon, that's all I'm not going to say: I make lots of sence; I believe in Jesus.
 tesss
 chocolate??! WHERE??
 <zym_47510> hi
 hi
 OH MY GOD DOLLEH NO!
 D:
 Dude, Becky is going to kick your arse now :o
 Vogon * by the way
 after all we God just is the worst mathimatition ever, 1+1+1=1 and 2+2=666 and still get correct answers.
 :P
 ITS NEVER LUPUS!
 TheOracle: It's pre-made, I'd have to find where to edit it to correct it ;).
 I see.
 See
 night Zymic
 Well, they obviously aren't devout H2G2 fans.
 night rebel
 read about Neitche Darius
 The creator of this client is French :)
 :@
 so?
 SO?
 SO!?
 Erm, AlizÃ©e is hot.
 so
 So, that means they're a cheese eating surrender monkey, clearly
 Everyone knows that
 s/cheese/snail
 frog
 I'm quoting there, TheOracle :p
 Makes more sense with snail, though.
 I've heard escargot tastes very nice :o
 I would try it at least once
 Chewy and smothered in garlic.
 I do like garlic!
 Chewy is not always a good thing :p
 Yummy.
 its like your stank breath
 oh damn
 Not a fan of chewy food though
 That's the reason I tend not to have much squid
 Facebook or Myspace
 Benpadgett..?
 Coke or Pepsi
 Coke
 ...
 no one likes Benpadgett 
 Diet Coke or Coke?
 Coke, duhu
 cooooooooooooooooooooooke
 Cherry Coke
 Diet tastes nasty
 No no, Diet Coke!
 No, Diet tastes better than normal coke..
 Pfft.
 That can be argued.
 DarkKrai - Dont talk to me then
 And Cherry coke is horrble, Benpadgett. I'd kill myself if I were you ;)
 Nah its well nice
 Diet Coke is much like Root Beer for me - I have a strong dislike towards it.
 Diet Coke > Coke Zero > Coke > Cherry Coke.
 Now, I've never tried Coke Zero...
 Tis nice.
 Cherry Coke > Coke > Coke Zero > Diet Coke 
 Shit son, you need a big hard slap ;)
 linux > osx > winxp >winvista > win7
 win 7
 oh wait
 WIN 7 AND WIN VISTA ARE THE SAME THING!
 linux > osx > winxp >winvista  sp2
 OSX > Windows 7 > Windows Vista > Windows XP > Linux > Windows 98 > Windows 95 > Acorn wooooah.
 nah win7 got little small tabs in task bar
 Win 7 is better
 Linux > OS X > Windows 7 > Windows XP > [...] [...] [...] Windows Vista
 win 95 obviously
 How is the ranking working here?
 TheOracle: you best b trollin
 Because if we're talking terms of functionality... Linux comes out top without breaking a sweat :p
 It seems... pleasant >.<
 linux > xp > 7 > all macs > all other windows os'
 And that's demonstrably true
 Linux servers are the best
 I'd probably place Windows ME after Windows Vista
 OSX is obviously second :)
 I do like osx's menus at the top
 Brandon: heck no
 Being based on UNIX ;)
 OS X is well good
 I use gnome2 global menus
 :d
 its awesome
 So,
 Nobody cares/
 .
 they took UNIX, and ruined it
 ;)
 Specifically FreeBSD Unix
 PS3 or XBOX 360
 Linux / Mac OS X / UNIX / etc > Windows 7 > Windows XP > Windos Vista > Windows ME
 DIE BENderPADGETT
 http://labs.snippicks.uni.cc/images/dum.png
 osx is < 7
 tbh, inbetween xp and 7
 bbs
 You mean we have to have you back Brandon?
 Brandon Brandon Brandon Brandon Brandon Brandon Brandon Brandon Brandon
 Pie`, see that, TRIVIUM

 what
 You deserve a kb for life tbh, Benpadgett. WHORE
 Linux / Mac OS X / UNIX / etc (Kubuntu is well nice as well) > Windows 7 > Windows XP > Windos Vista > Windows ME
 whos THIS guy, SPAMMING 'Brandon Brandon Brandon Brandon Brandon Brandon Brandon Brandon Brandon'
 Nick alert spam is a kickable offense, just so you know, Benpadgett
 oops.....
 DarkKrai...
 I gotta run, eating tyme.
 TheOracle: I won't agree with you till at least 7 is > OS X ;)
 Brandon: and perhaps you could handle these things with a sensibly worded warning rather than shooting your mouth off :p
 ;)
 It wasn't me!
 FYI, tis my hands hehe :)
 xuhi

 thats nice Seth :p
 it'd be cool if it scrolled up when you clicked the link again
 or scroleld up then scrolled down with the new info if you already had one out
 Scrolled up? As in remove the old info as well?
 yeah
 so if you had the bio up, and you clicked code
 the bio scrolled up then code scrolled down
 How about the bio scrolls up and away, and the code scrolls into it's place? :p
 the bio's place*
 thats what I meant :D
 http://docs.jquery.com/Effects/slideUp
 Thats for the bio to leave
 have you looked into jQueryUI ?
 there are some really nice effects there
 Tim you here ?
 I am
 What do you think is better, left or right http://ben-thomson.co.uk/nCi.png ?
 left
 Maybe left but go easy on the shadow
 Left isn't finished, I hate doing UI :(
 left but make the toolbar & hotkeys button smaller
 Thats a tab control :D
 personally id prefer the right one
 i like things better on basic versions...
 Left has animations.
 that's because you're silly JaXm 
 :/
 :P
 Pie`: It looks good but appears to be sparingly documentated for show( 'slide', ...)
 Anyone here do any c#.net?
 Yes
 I can only find demos, no documentation Pie`
 Yes i know yo dou ben ;)
 Ben? Msn?
 am going out in a bit
 Okay
 I think anyway, dont wanna get into convos with brehs on msn xD
 Brehs?
 People
 right :P
 Pie`: I think I'll just stick with standard jQuery
 kk
 in disk fragmentation
 is a lot of blue good ?
 iirc, yes
 actually no

 css3?
 I haven't used any css3 techniques there besides text-shadow which I believe is css3
 right
 The transition effects are in jQuery
 oh I didn't even noticed the effect, didn't bother clicking
 ic that the content will stick after clicking on the links, it won't go away
 I know
 I don't see why it should go away ;-)

 AMAZING ^^^^^^^^^^^
 Seen it before I think
 http://iwantddos.co.uk/seth/beta Are the links for #follow readable?
 yes/no, they are too litgh for that background
 hmm
 Bit more horizontal padding would be nice :p
 And usability generally mandates that link elements have a hover state
 was going to do that later alex
 As long as it gets done :p
 but I need to find a base color first
 Then that's all that counts
 Hmm
 might be good to have a third color, only see two colours on your site
 You might also look into this
 If you click code, and then your name
 The previous paragraph shifts
 yes I'm not quite sure how to fix that at the moment, probably set it to position: absolute
 Thats how I fixed the links area, kept moving
 er #follow area
 This a personal site, or a portfolio thing
 Personal
 Presumably personal given the wording
 Thought it probably was, seemed quite informal
 yes, I'm not usually formal :p
 Well, yeah, people generally aren't :p
 Reload, how does #follow look now?
 I don't think I like it
 But I have to ask because you get a lot of people who seem to think a portfolio shouldn't be treated like a CV ;)
 haha
 Still think it could do with more padding myself :p
 Padding... where?
 Around the text in each #follow link
 ah probably
 Having no padding only really works when you're highlighting things, if they're semantically a button, you need padding I think
 oooh looks good now
 yea
 Yeah, I quite like that shade as well :)
 Is that enough padding? (reload) I just have to increase the width of the <p>
 Looks alright to me now
 great :)
 Alright width increased
 Now, for a hover effect... I was thinking invertion
 invert the colors
 It's definitely worth a go
 or, rather flip really
 Yeah, I knew what you meant :p
 There try that
 I like it
 Can't say I particularly do :p
 It does make the text unreadable on hover though
 Hmm
 How about make the background darker?
 That was what I was going to screenshot :p
 http://animetakenotifier.zxq.net
 Alex: try now I really like this
 I think that look ok, the hover state blue is a bit overvibrant compared to the other colours - but it's not /bad/ :p
 I love it
 It actually looks rather better on my laptop screen
 Probably because of the weaker colour range :p
 eh
 what can you do :p
 Alright, lets see
 Oh yes the mysterious moving paragraph
 It doesn't look bad on the better monitor, it just doesn't look as good ;)
 I have noticed this before
 I've picked out colours on my laptop monitor
 Because GIMP tends to open there
 But my browser is on my external, so it suddenly looks different :p
 I always forget
 the moving paragraph is because of the margin
 SETH
 the paragraphs are overlapped!
 yes I'm testing scenarios Andrew
 RAWR FIX IT!
 its fixed now
 no
 there's a red box
 wtf
 So I can see the element's sizes
 really? use firebug
 or webdeveloper toolbar
 I'm using Chrome
 lol we are firebuggin your site seth
 chrome has extension support now, don't they have firebug?
 use the damn built in dev tools
 dunno
 onle windows version
 link me to it
 [17:34:16] <dronix> the moving paragraph is because of the margin << what margin
 seth: https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/bnbbfjbeaefgipfjpdabmpadaacmafkj
 http://sharpielovers.com/images/grabs/trippin/12-30-2009-6-41-04-PM.png lmfao
 Why is it sooo bloody hard to read
 ?
 it's EXACT from your site
 no
 yes
 the firebug window has shadows on it
 wut?
 damnit tinygrab
 http://grab.by/1sJ9
 firebug should look like this: http://sharpielovers.com/images/grabs/trippin/12-30-2009-6-43-17-PM.png
 seth that's an all white screenshot
 I know -.-
 http://grab.by/1sJb
 wtf
 again
 tinygrab is failin me
 empty seth
 this sucks
 firebug won't show me the contents of <body>
 pure rubbish
 don't u have firefox installed?
 no damnit, I hate firefox -.-
 [17:38:28] <Seth> I'm using Chrome
 yes I know, but thought u had it installed anyways
 No
 You're not a real web developer then
 You're just a fake
 heh
 I have ALL the damn browsers installed...
 well top 5 popular
 I've never tested on opera lol
 Opera is rubbish as well
 only have ff,chrome, and the 3s IE
 imo chrome is better because (from what i know) it does everything all the other browsers do
 and does it better
 It's not as cross-platform as either Firefox or Opera, or even Konqueror for that matter.
 uh, yeah it is
 does konquerer work on mac?
 Yep
 so does chrome
 I always test on either Opera or Safari, normally if there's an error on one, it'll show on the other
 Well done
 However it's a limited version that's out at the moment
 it wasnt that limited when I used it
 easy e im not a geezer
 it had all the same functionality the last windows released version did, ignoring the most recent beta release
 Thing is, I'd be willing to accept Chromium as competing
 I'm running chrome 4.0.249.43 on my mac atm, no extension support yet :(
 dronix: extension support is only beta on windows  atm :p
 although it works perfectly fine
 But since Chrome is only officially supported on a small set of platforms (namely, OSX, some Windows, some Linux)
 yes, firebug doesn't seem to be working right as pointed out by seth
 That extension sucks...
 It's never going to do better than Firefox.
 Chromium however, could
 Actually seth it's your shitty browser
 FO Andrew
 :D
 I really like chrome, if I could import my plugins from ff I would be sold
 dronix, get the beta
 hes on mac Robert
 [23:54:50] <dronix> I'm running chrome 4.0.249.43 on my mac atm, no extension support yet :(
 get wise, get a PC, then get the beta
 Does it allow a set of tabs as "home", rather than one home page in the beta?
 yes Alex
 no need to have a new pc, I have two vms running windows xp and w7 respectively
 Shame the current stable version doesn't
 As far as I can work out anyway
 It certainly doesn't use the same | delimited format Firefox does
 I don't think so Alex
 Right, well that's two conflicting reports :p
 it didn't by default
 chrome doesnt work with fb
 enough said
 matt: wrong ?
 the main reason for the net
 if anyhting it works better than all the others
 nah chat doesnt work for me
 because the js engine it uses is far superior :p
 yes
 Arguable
 it's been tested Alex
 on several tests
 on several machines, by several people
 Arguable benchmarks, because it's very good at recursion
 And so it does some forms of calculation very well
 And in fact, those are the main ones the V8 benchmark tests, sunspider is a bit more rounded, but there's no hugely clear winner there
 It's a constant case of leapfrog with that metric
 the onyl real problem I've ever had in chrome was in 3.x versions(as far as i am aware) flash would sometimes uses insane amounts of resources
 V8 is a good engine, but it's not light-years ahead of anyone
 like, > 70% of the CPU
 and stupid amount of RAM
 but that appears to be fixed in 4.x
 Flash has always been a problem, shame HTML5 is so far off really
 And that Apple fucked the community over by refusing to support an open codec.
 Not that google were keen.
 They spent quite a while prevaricating over the issue
 Took (guess who) Mozilla to get them to change their mind and say they'd support Theora ;)
 :(
 It's not very English of me, but I really don't see the point of tea either :p
 Patriotic as I am, I agree ;)
 tea FTW
 I generally drink more Diet coke than any other drink :)
 eww diet coke
 The kind without proper flavour eh, Brandon?
 Diet coke <3
 I find it taste better than normal Coke
 Coke Zero & Diet Coke = win.
 I also drink Monster energy drink, win all the time :)
 Diet Coke has the best flavour
 you just love coke zero cause of the ads don't ya brandon? XD
 I'm with Dave ;)
 The pepsi adverts (I think it's them) have been quite good recently :p
 Dolleh: Which coke ads?
 It annoys when people criticising me for drinking it, saying I don't need to lose weight bla bla bla
 It's clearly a tast thing
 I like the one where it's a guy in interview, and he starts smashing things up, screamings, dunks himself in the fish tank :p
 Then bodily throws himself out the door
 alex, it can't be them if you can't remember who's the ad from :P
 Into a chair, then runs away, taking all but one of the applicants with him :p
 If you've seen it you know the one I mean.
 Most adverts are terrible, I'll take a vaguely amusing one where I can get it :p
 At least with Christmas over, the number of perfume adverts should be on the way down
 Those are invariably peculiar.
 Surreal at best
 goodnight quimdogs
 Can't say I've used it myself, but I have used it to see how they achieved something, then did it myself.  Because I was working on a project I didn't intend to release at the time, so practice was good
 night matt x
 Heh
 The Nexus One has been rooted before its official release
 Alex, have you ever known a web server to not send mails sent with mail() to .info domains but work on all others?
 Better than just after I guess
 Though somewhat embarassing I'll grant ;)
 Indeed
 Andrew: can't say I have.
 Enjoy debugging things like that, mail servers are notoriously overcomplicated ;)
 strange, because zymic.com server seems to be doing just that 
 Oh, well, I guess if you're right Ed gets to enjoy debugging it then
 heh
 I don't have any other .info domains to test either :\

 just one, mail sent to it from other email clients is fine, mail sent to it from mail() is failing
 CSS wasn't so lucky though -.-
 Seth: of course, since none of that has been ratified, you have no idea if it /will/ be valid HTML5 ;)
 It's not time to use that doctype yet :p
 well
 there isn't really any HTML5 elements in there
 I was just too lazy to type a HTML 4.1 doctype
  get textexpander
 4.01*
 er yes
 and no dronix: I'm find with vim thank you, if thats an editor
 not an editor
 don't know the description, but I've come to like it very much
 link me
 speeds up coding quite a lot

 6
 dronix: 
 watever
 He does last more books than Gandalf.  But Gandalf comes back to life
 So he wins really.
 They should fight
 epic
 Not a real competition, dumbledore is a mere human :p
 with *magic*
 I don't think either would win really
 r we still talkin about hp?
 Dumbledore v. Gandalf dronix
 No, we stopped talking about laptops a while ago, dronix
 who is gandalf?
 Wizard from Lord of the rings & the Hobbit
 Either you are very uncultured, or that was a joke :p
 oh right, that he was somewhere inside hp
 dronix... *sigh* you're a lost case!! 'who is gandalf... wow'  
 *thought
 I didn't know who gandalf was either... I never read or watched the lord of the rings
 wow andrew
 Andrew is a Dumblebore
 andrew lord of the rings is more of an europe thing I guess
 meh, I never could get past the first few pages of the book, and therefore never wasted money on the movies
 no, it's major here, just never wanted to see it
 I've never read the books
 Definitely lost cases :p
 They're a genre defining set of books

 Don't know what version that was
 That was v5
 oh Im thinking priot to that andrew haha

 good old times
 There's only been one green one to my recollection
 And that was v5 :p

 and all those collapsable panels XD
 In Alba

 Because in those days Alba was cool
 When they made the store Alex

 Hi
 http://minimalgoogle.zxq.net/  can i know why this site is banded
 bwahaha version 3: http://web.archive.org/web/20031003130522/http://zymic.com/
 god that pixel font was allover zymic at one point
 Well, up until v5
 then the templates got onto a .net cd
 Zymic offered several download packs of pixel fonts :p
 and it exploded somewhat
 I remeber
 I had them all :P
 zym_32965: I suggest you read the topic again, this is general chat. Move to #hosting
 It offered shoutbox scripts to download :)
 And a PHP tutorial from Jeyrad about PHP's POST and GET functions :')
 yup
 Oh yes alex!
 haha
 I remeber in the first forums
 chronic did a GD tut
 with forum stats
 and we all made our own xD
 man you zymics should have a timeline thingy lol
 :O
 yes!
 With notes :)
 "This is the golden era of Zymic, the time when in short succession both Ed and Alex joined" ;)
 haha
 Lmao :p
 I met adam via PM here
 cos we both had 1&1 hosting
 havent broken contact in 7 years
 madness!
 haha
 spoken to him almost daily for that time period XD
 "Stories tell of a heavenly fanfare, however much of early v5 has been lost to myth"
 Maybe I shouldn't be allowed to do the notes ;)
 I remeber the teamspeak and ventrillo escapades Alex
 with young Jeyrad
 I definitely remember TS
 and his girly squeek
 Where's this written Alex? :P
 We had a video of "GODDAYUM" for ages
 and mouthy tom
 video?  Recording I mean
 haha I remember XD
 I was Timo back then :O
 W00t
 damn, the v5 coming soon page was up for MONTHS
 lol
 lol
 it was indeed
 I'm looking the wayback machine and every day in 04 it's there
 I remember that one
 Well, that wasn't a planned transition
 But I still remember a green alien looking layout I could have sworn was zymics
 That was one of the previous admins using his password to "hack" the site
 IIRC
 haha
 I miss those good times
 :(
 soo many people have come and gone!
 I've been here nearly 2 years now
 wait
 like
 What was the name of that guy
 I came back andrew
 after a 2 yr break
 february is 2 years
 July 18th 2008
 Who then left, set up an IRC network
 and knew only alex bread adam and jack from the olden days
 Chronic?
 yeah
 february 14th no less. I signed up on forums on VALENTINES day lmao
 I mentioned him earlier :D
 Don't think it was him, Ed
 oh: ?
 Something Freeze?
 SmallR2006?
 Or whatever year it was :p
 ohh yeah, Robert
 Hey Robert 
 I remeber SmallR**** LOL nothing of him just always thought nicks were alpha and wonder why tom sat above him :P
 One thing I remember
 Tommy wanted ass
 lol Andrew xD
 Less mature times :p
 Screenshot of where the forum had cut "assistance" off
 In bed
 Well I just worked out
 I first went to zymic in sep 2002 :)
 so its just passed 7 years ;)
 has anyone here got assassins creed 2?
 koolcode, what on earth do you want?
 Hey
 Good choice
 Robert: your vpnreferral code is misbehaving again. jack asked me to inform you whats going on
 I still remember being "new" here :p
 haha
 I remember it all
 He's already told me
 We have to do somthing for 10 years guys!
 Even though I haven't been considered new for almost five years or so :p
 Well, so you have fixed it already ?
 Yes
 I used ChatZilla... Ridiculous 
 Hmm .. okay I never told jack what the fix was.
 Anyways, cya
 You guys seemed so intimidating on a black bg haha
 Alex, arrange a Zymic Prom
 Tim I like the justice mix of it better
 hehe
 yeah wooo
 I like to think I was immediately warm and not at all condescending to people who joined after me
 I /like/ to think that ;)
 Alex you were a complete dick to me
 hehe
 Haha
 Andrew
 JUSSSSSSSSSST kidding :D
 lol
 he was to me
 Seriously
 I used to BUG THE SHIT out of alex about php
 oh wow, he was nice to me
 to the pount he'd pick on me about my spelling
 :P
 Infact
 Same here...
 I left once over it :P
 I always bugged Ed about php
 for around 9 mnths
 :P
 And maybe share a minor code injection flaw in Komodo CMS with all of Zymic's staff :p
 and not TOO often
 But I only did that once
 OH YES!
 Alex
 I still do occasionally
 all the JS
 xD
 Last time was about 2 days ago?
 But you did then teach me sanitizing
 :D
 has anyone here got assassins creed 2?
 Lots of infinite alert() loops :p
 Good times
 Yup
 and innerHtml :P
 The alert loop was Tom's idea :p
 Was a XXS fest
 psyrens haha
 remember his blog?
 tomsmit.com?
 haha
 where he talked about his bad knee for ever
 I beleive the article was called, A pain in teh knee
 :P
 Tom focussed on the alert loops, I worked on replacing your front page with a black screen with "LOL" on it in huge red letters :)
 I remeber well alex :)
 <3 you
 Did the same to Adam mind you
 with his TheSquadren mechima XD
 SQL injection
 LOL http://web.archive.org/web/20041230092241/http://www.zymic.com/
 Heh, I've gotten him on CSRF before
 what andrew?
 I remeber that
 :)
 ITS THE SHOUT BOX :D
 took ALL year to get V5 up and then it goes down in hours
 And there was the one time as a prank I moved all the files in his website to another directory :p
 the begginings of IRC
 :D
 He thought he had been hacked, and wiped his whole account
 That one kinda backfired
 He was annoyed at me for a while after that
 But he was the one who deleted it all :p
 Well, to be fair he HAD been hacked :p
 "well over 200 members, a record of around 70+ online"
 LOL
 hahaha
 XD
 I remeber I got picked on
 I was away when the second forum went live
 and ended up as user 28
 when all the guys in here were 1-7
 :P
 SEE HOW PICKY THEY WERE
 I still am :)
 :\ I'm like 10,000 something
 I'm more than 10000
 But then again I don't use the forums much
 haha
 I could have Tim
 some dick stole it
 I used them too much the first year I was there
 :P
 eneded up as php at one point
 10,089 is my user
 I think I've posted three or four times total
 Im at 0
 :D
 I'm relatively low on posts
 Rob is 44994 lol
 I've got 641
 Let's see
 Andrew has 2,830, even ahead of Ed :p
 I'm ahead of everyone :\
 My post count per day was at 15 at one point
 now at 4 per day
 I like to think I stick to quality not quantity ;)
 There's so many repeat questions, I delete more than I post :P
 I want to know why there are 3 people in the top 20 list, if you sort by profile views who have < 10 posts, but SO MANY PROFILE VIEWS
 http://sharpielovers.com/images/grabs/trippin/12-30-2009-8-37-33-PM.png
 catalin has 0 posts but double jacks profile views
 Andrew

 I could be quite low if I wanted
 Would take so long to work it out though
 Tim Profile Views: 999*
 Yeah, 2 is free
 haha

 Good morning :)
 ey brandy
 sup
 oh dear :/
 Atleast I wont get tired early tonight ;)
 Ben
 videod some UI stuff I wrote :D
 you know apple apps have that purple srounded rect with numbers in aka "badges"
 I wrote them into the iphone os publically as apple never released the code :D
 :O nice, link ?
 uploading now ben :D
 Yay :D
 I wrote it so its 100% dynamic in size and position
 so if you set the little more info button in your table cell
 it will shift
 when it goes into edit mode it hides
 etx
 http://dznr.org/ye34
 :D
 Adds badgeNumber property to table cells
 Looks great tim :D How long it tame you ? bit strange they didn't put it into iPhone.
 so it feels just like apple code
 took about 2 hrs drunk last night to complete
 hehe drunk coding ftw
 ben it uses no images :)
 Even better :)
 Right, happy new year all
 See you tomorrow
 Happy new year to you to Robert :)
 Only have combo boxes left to style an Im done woo
 Have a good one Robert  :)
 sup doods
 lol
 once again
 I get asked by a client
 "Are you gay?"
 WHY SHOULD IT MATTER?!
 it matters a lot
 no one wants to fill the pockets of the gay agenda
 lol
 :) No homofobia or discrimination lenny
 homophobia even
 Next time I break out my big pink PVC ban hammer ;)
 ( ï¾âï¾)ï½± u mad
 :P still client, no reason to discriminate against a gay person...
 No need to do it at all!
 haha
 don't have to like it but you don't have to ask about it
 don't ask don't tell doesn't work
 that's what all the liberals tell me
 meh I don't go for that
 dont ask dont tell is bollocks
 You're saying cos Im gay I have to be closed about it
 I cant be open gay and proud? :P
 I have to be a recluse
 no thanks
 Freedom doesnt work if its only sometimes people ;)
 a study with a set of twins, one gay one straight proved sexuality is defined by a gene activated due to presence of hormones at birth
 its a mixture of nature and nurture
 so you'rer saying homosexuality is a genetic defect?
 good to know
 not a defect at all :/
 Its a preset if anything
 people have been gay through out time
 roman population on mass were bi sexual
 and they're all dead now
 coincidence?
 infact many pre renaissance societies were
 No lenny
 romans still exist lol
 as in most of europe are of roman decent
 that or angalo norman :P
 anglo*
 Whats your issue with homosexuality Lenny?
 I don't have issues
 why so negative about it?
 I argue for the sake of arguing
 tis a subject close to my heart :P
 that just makes it more enjoyable
 I'd kill for the subject if I had to :P
 RAWR
 :O
 Is Lenny sexy ?

 Dolleh tell me something from the future!
 its shiney and loud and smelly and one big cloud

 how is 2010?
 and a bunch of people are shooting mothafucking expensive stuff up in the air, crazy some pricey things in here
 yes there are robo dino' s eating cars!
 moms car just transformed into a bunny and hopped away 
 i' m hanging out of my window looking at fireworks, and mr the creepy-guy is glaring at me again D:
 someone should beat him up mkay?
 *_*
 lol one idiot set his garden on fire by accident...
 I swear at least 2 families in the neighbourhood must have sold their house to pay all their fireworks... they have expensive stuff
 how the heck do you catch a garden on fire
 no idea.. but he managed...
 theres a tree and a buch and a fenge on fire lol fail
 sounds like the burn the town down every year
 yep, welcome in my town
 they start firing with bugs in the morning
 and end in the night with fireworks and burning gardens and cars
 all tho the burnings cars start in the early evening already |T_T
 I aint changing that all the last minutes, pfft
 pfft
 slacker
 ya supposed to countdown 10...9....8....7
 pfft
 jack, I don' t get paid for it ;)
 you' ll have to do with the cheap way
 That wasn't Jack :p
 jaxm*
 sorry jack D:
 But I'm sure he appreciated the nick alerts
 why aint you out alex? :P
 scary people in here, still irc-ing
 Because I have a migraine and almost chucked up about an hour ago :p
 awws
 I time these things perfectly every year ;)
 XD
 So Alex you can time your migrains?
 Well, not consciously
 But it seems like I have them scheduled for my birthday, christmas day and new years :p
 Ahh, I have a really bad headache. Have for the past 6 days
 Actually 7 days I had it just before christmas
 7 days without gaps?
 If so, see a doctor.
 It gets stronger and weak throughout the day, sometimes seems to go away but I only notice when it's here
 That isn't normal.
 Typical maximum is 2-3 days
 I blame it on me having a cold for a few days then catching a flu as my cold went away
 For one attack
 I assume it's sinus pressure
 Could be
 In which case you could get in for one of the more interesting migraine treatments :p
 For people who get it because of tense muscles, they treat migraines with botox
 I woke up without it this morning, but it kicked in within an hour and has only gotten worse. Thought I could deal with it but finally gave in and took some ibuprophen
 Not kidding ;)
 just go get a massage andrew
 Wow... 
 It causes the muscles to relax
 And that then means the cause of the migraine is gone
 Hrm, always assumed the opposite
 Dolleh, willing to give me one? I'll keep my clothes on :P
 Nah, it's immobile because they're relaxed and you can't tense them
 Rather than because it's constantly tense
 hmm if you keep your clothes on, sure
 makes sense, I guess I never thought about it. 
 Which is why people who get botox don't have all of their face muscles scrunched up all the time :p
 Rather, an expressionless mask.
 Anyhoo, that's why they do it
 alex knows scary much about botox....
 I think I know about as much as is expected by popular culture
 suuure
 Apart from that it's used for some migraines
 But that's more knowing about migraines
 Certainly, if you don't know what I know about botox a fair few jokes in sitcoms won't make sense.
 There are definitely cases of assumed knowledge about it in Scrubs.
 Alex, a migraine consists of headache and what else?
 Well, mine come with nausea
 The other thing is vision effects, like seeing flashing lights
 I get those a bit as well, but nowhere near as much
 That's strange, the nausea. Is it known what causes that?
 Guess I could google, sorry
 No, they don't really know anything about how migraines work
 The treatments they do have (anti-histamines, the triptan family of drugs)
 They don't know why those work
 They've just been shown to work better than placebo, so they use them :p
 http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/148373.php this seems to understand why it happens
 There was a theory that it was to do with blood flow
 But that's gone out of fashion in the medical world
 thnx andrew
 :P figured you been doing it all evening
 XD
 As it happens, the hospital near my university has a researching migraine department
 So I have this on fair authority
 ahh
 TOO EARLY!!!!
 NO IT WAS ONE SECOND AFTER!
 LIES
 [18:59:01] *
 better Dolleh ?
 âªâ|Â°Ð·Â°|ââª â|Â°ÎµÂ°|ââª â|Â°Ð·Â°|ââª
 I waited 3 seconds after
 MERRY NEW YEAR FROM MERRY OL' ENGLAND
 too early again ;_;
 either your computer is wrong or mine is wrong Dolleh 
 happy new year alex, jack and and the rest of the uk-ers out there
 5 hours for US
 Eastern time zone at least :P
 screw the rest of the time zones here
 lolz
 now you can do the count downs for us kay andrew? ;)
 I aint staying up for that, I think
 You'll be here, the fireworks will keep you up for a while
 their almost gone here ;_;
 They've already started about an hour ago here
 retards
 just some crappy guys playing with bugs, and people hugging and kisses eachother new year >_>
 Anyone notice PayPal's christmas logo?
 "playing with bugs" I assume you don't mean insects?
 no, lol
 its streetname for it that we use here
 for fireworks?
 no, its this gunpowder that normally is used for shotguns
 its a countryside thing to fill tin cans with the gunpowder aka bugs in here, close the can and light it, so the top gets blown off
 its illigal, in countrysides they still use it tho, but in city you can go to jail for doing this :P
 no active policestation in here, so junkies running around playing with bugs every new years eve :P
 lol WOOOW
 lol :P welcome in holland andrew
 Dolleh, don't yell at me but it should say "welcome to holland"
 not in
 i noticed you said "in" earlier but didn't say anything thinking it was just a one-time mistake
 they love to dump it in the sewage and then RUN, last year they blew up some part of the pipes, and around the mayors house it was flooded, I laughed many times
 my english is crappy, thnx for correcting! :)
 Hey Andrew
 2009 sucks
 you loser
 2010 atw
 and hows uk-ish 2010 jack?
 Big killing robots 
 ohnoes!
 2nd year I didn' t shake hands/kissed real people to wish them happy new year lol
 next year i've forgotten what socialising was
 Thanks Jack, stupid from the future jack 
 Yeh its pretty cool; I have robotic arms and everything
 easier for you to ban those spammers :D
 I just got kissed by my moms boyfriend D:... AGAIN
 all mom' s boyfriends seem to try that ;_;
 i want a domain
 They are like $8
 I'll buy you Andrew.com
 Jack Andrew.com is taken
 and I know they are only $7.50 right now, just have to find one that's not taken
 Damn
 Good luck; they're all taken by squatters. The domain name system is flawed and dirty.
 andrewbaker.net is for sale for $1,288
 ugh
 That is not worth $100
 I know...
 it's LONG, and a .net
 You're lucky you bought zymic.com in 2002
 Every possible domain is taken and owned by some 12yo who thinks he/she is going to sell the name for a million dollars
 Zymic is worthless anyway as a name
 If it was 4 letters then that's another story
 There should be a law you have to have a popular site on it, and none of those damn parked pages or else it goes for sale
 how can I make steve notice me about purchasing mail?
 Typo domains are the worst. People make profit from your visitors.
 !purchasemail dronix
 he PM's not notice
 ah ic
 would vorob.com be a dumb domain name?
 Just want something short, doesn't have to mean anythin
 g
 nn
 #1 loser award goes to... Jack
 wow off to bed early
 my mom and her bf are smoking spliffs ;_; i' ll come and annoy andrew for a bit now
 yo, does anyone have steve's source?
 what' s up with all those bots in hosting :/
 thats me doing some test
 aha...
 :D
 Cheers, happy new year to you too, Dolleh.
 Wandered off to watch a bit of the Jools Holland thing that's on every year, but it was nothing special this year
 Not like the year they had the Ukelele Orchestra of Great Britain on and they played Smells Like Team Spirit :p
 s/Team/Teen/
 Dronix I don't, but I have a similar bot, and Bass_Guitar made Steve, so he would. Do we really need another bot though? You could just use sBot's !tell command to tell robert to add another function
 No bot testing in official channels
 well yeh, don't see the need for another bot, just wanted to add some more $tells
 If I were in #hosting I'd have said there :p
 You mean like !purchasemail?
 I had my own HostBot at one point
 yes, just wanted to add !wordpress !ftp etc
 He automatically said something on certain key phrases
 Had it set to ignore the regs too
 don't know what happened to him
 dronix you can play around in #test, that's what it's there for
 well I have my bot running on #testing but don't know how to grab the input from let say !purchasemail input
 Any number of string functions
 Is this PHP?
 String manipulation is one of the key things you want to understand in any programming language
 oh thnx alex
 happy new year :)
 <3 you all
 mom and mr BF are sitting downstairs lolling about the word  "beep" ...wow...
 Night ended early for me :/
 Has anyone told you, you're my hero Tim?
 timmie! :D
 Went to pub
 why home so soon?
 Now you must be an Ed, because conversations with an average of 30 minute gaps between replies are standard for Ed :p
 then to friends
 his dog had a fit at 00:02
 not me alex? D:
 and died :/
 D:
 yeahhh
 tim D: moms bf kissed me T_T
 This is why girls have knees
 :O
 to go weak alex? :P
 Heh, sure, why not :p
 what were you gonna say alex? :
 :P
 :/
 I was going for a rather disabling tactic that women are allowed to employ
 Im drunk
 lamemans terms?
 Knee -> crotch.
 I think that's about as layman as I can get :p
 oh!
 Alex made a funny!
 haha
 VAGINA
 thats more laymans
 :P
 Tim: I think he means more a male crotch than female
 unless your men have vaginas? ;)
 nah
 cocks and bums here
 :P
 Not entirely unheard of, Pie`.  I just aim too high for this audience I think ;)
 what did one butt cheek said to the other?
 answer: damn that hallway smells
 Moving swiftly onwards
 heh
 Anyone here do new year's resolutions?  Can't say I do, I'd never keep them if I did :p
 I should do stand up
 You might just do quite well, dronix... in the US :p
 heh
 that'll be my new year's resolution
 Alex, is it new years already where you live?
 Yes
 It's almost two
 Alex: Mine was to stop making resolutions
 so I kinda failed that already :s
 Good show
 I am
 :)
 Hope my theory of computation book turns up tomorrow.  I could do with starting revision for that exam.
 my resolution is to loose the last little bit of wieght and start boxing again, and tell my mother and father im gay
 thats about it
 "<Alex> Knee -> crotch."  this is called kick em in tha balls alex
 A suitably late reply, you're doing well at this Ed business, Dolleh :)
 and thats why men hate heel shoes
 ;_; its new years even and i' m watching madonna' s concert alex ;_;
 I aint no ed ;_;
 Tim, your parents don't know?
 Meant as a compliment, everyone loves good old Ed
 nooooo andrew
 god my step dad even has a twitter, they both have facebook
 atm i' m wearing 9 cm high heels alex, be nice to me? ;)
 my dad went to prison for 48 days for attacking a gay man in the army :P
 Or maybe that should just be old old Ed these days, another year gone and all :p
 it'd be hard for me to cover something like that lol
 ohhhhh understandable then Tim :\
 yea
 :/
 Unless you get heels which can cross the channel, I'm feeling ok about things ;)
 You could go all out and just bring a guy over and say it's your lover to them over dinner :D
 Alex Dolleh is coming to stay with me in feb
 damn Tim, with a history like that must be difficult to communicate your feelings with your dad
 we will come visit you
 :)
 very dronix
 In Feb eh, I'll be in York around then
 running away from us huh alex?
 awesome
 :)
 Would anyone be opposed to me asking what seems to be a simple php question but for some reason isn't so simple to myself?
 Tim: ah you got it covered, once they get to know dolleh, they'll prefer you were gay
 Rather would anyone be willing to answer :P
 lmfao dronix
 yep, tim planned it all
 Andrew: go ahead
 yuk the livingroom smells like high and drunk people

 I'm willing to go to google for this if I would know what the heck to search for
 Uhuh, so presumably explode is giving different numbers of arguments each time
 If you do an isset() check before use, or a check against count() you could eliminate that
 Because undefined offset is a fairly clear error, you're trying to access an array element which doesn't exist.
 WOW you're so right....
 that solves that, can't believe I never noticed that
 :\
 Thanks a bunch alex
 Well the thing was I was just defining a variable with an offset in it, and the variable wasn't being called so I never really thought much about it
 It's easy to be blind about your own bugs :p
 Some bugs in particular
 but the offset it was assigning was definitely NOT there, so I'll do the isset 
 Like, one which has annoyed me a few times
 Because PHP allows for { .. } blocks without a construct around them, you can have cases where you've done
 for(...); { ... }
 Either only executes the body once, or loops forever depending on the for construct.
 You might be surprised how many times you can look at it and not see the semicolon :p
 Anyhoo, time for some sleep
 nigth alex
 night*
 And definitely bed time for you Dolleh, it's only really Ed I expect to be up past three ;)

 Seth: 162
 kthnx
 I just let other people do it for me :D
 anyone used the HTC hero with that app for places of interest?
 used it last night. basically point the video camera in a direction and it points out places like pubs etc and exactly where they are in the video
 insane
 what has the video camera got to do with it? Would it use like google maps kinda thing and spot where you are then say whats around you
 True, it obviously finds out where you are by the picture from teh camera
 and then can point out ON THE VIDEO (like he said) where those places are
 Well, yeah but hows it going to recognise where u are
 That's a huge step forward compared to looking at a map, you don't always know EXACTLY where something is when looking at a map
 FROM THE FUCKING PICTURE ARE YOU BLIND?!
 no
 it does it using the accelerometer and gps
 then it overlays a 3d layout
 of the position of places
 Okayy.....Calm :P It was just a question
 when you see it for the first time you are like holy shit
 Ha

 Alex
 Seth?
 Can you please change my vhost to sthrs.me
 is ti normal for an OS to send not many packets but recieve millions ?
 cause im on almost 100k sent, but 2.2m receievd
 That does seem relatively normal to me
 just thought 2million was a bit high
 This any good http://tinyurl.com/y9bonh5 ?
 perfect for porn ben :)
 how do you know so well tim? ;)
 oh I have no porn collection :)
 hehe wooooo
 damned
 320GB = £54.99 or 500GB = £69.99 ?
 is there a special reason you're getting an external hdd Ben? 
 'cause you can get a 1TB internal drive for like £55 :p
 I need extra space
 29GB left on my laptop
 I can get hard drives for like $39
 good size
 mm... as it's a laptop then yeah, external would be a smart move
 newegg has alot of specials if you have the time
 I got £20 amazon voucher so thought may as well use that
 and send rebates off and get parts really cheap
 does newegg deliver to the UK though malt? 
 Not last time I checked
 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136358
 there is 500GB
 but that's internal malt
 oh
 and the wrong dimension
 Alex: Can you please change my vhost to sthrs.me
 I look for external
 Does Newegg.com ship internationally?
 Newegg.com does not currently ship internationally; we only deliver to locations within the United States and to Puerto Rico.
 Seth, done
 Thanks
 http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136474
 500GB external
 but then still redundant malt
 as they don't deliever outside of the US
 it does
 [20:16:43] <&Alex> Newegg.com does not currently ship internationally; we only deliver to locations within the United States and to Puerto Rico.
 * Std. Shipping is not available to AK, HI and PR.
 oh
 ebay probably has them
 same price new 
 but ebay sucks
 go to ebuyer
 I look for good feedback and people who has been members a while if I buy anything
 what is wrong with eBay Pie`
 you're never garunteed a decent sale
 and there isn't really a great deal you can do about it
 17 new from £54.99 1 used from £63.61  hmm i wonder what one I want.
 eBay most of the time just replies with something along the lines of "meh"

 I wish the remote had a back and forward button like web browsers
 Samsung remotes at least do have a "Pre-CH" button, that takes you to the last channel you were on
 But yeah, bit more flexibility wouldn't go amiss.
 Ooh didn't know that, might buy a samsung then.
 you might buy a specified brand of TV just for 1 set of buttons? XD
 are you so lazy you cant remember the channel you were just on ?
 I didn't know what channel it was on in the first place.
 Hmm
 Ssl isn't working

 Right am going to watch knowing brb
 apple <3's people. microsoft <$'s people.
 does anyone here know how to work itunes? :/
 i cant get the damn thing onto my ipod
 si seÃ±or
 ha whats the problem..
 itunes wont "complete" transferring this file
 error ?
 no
 its just stopped
 says 1.44gb of 1.44 GB transferred
 i cant pause it
 i cant stop it
 i cant open it
 thats weird :\
 never got that before
 if i restart itunes the file disappears and i have to re-transfer it
 ok it stopped transferring
 but now how do I get ti to my ipod ;o
 robert just give me a sec please
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNMggq_NADg&feature=player_embedded
 so sad :(
 made me cry
 Tim: help, how do i transfer videos to my ipod from itunes D:
 hello again robert
 just need your assistance once more robert
 hey all
 im right about ready to fucking murder appl
 Pie`, why?
 got dvd token thing to get xmen origins for free download or something from itunes
 i download the movie, it says its finished... clicked on sync videos with my ipod 
 u still paying for movies n music?
 itunes deleted EVERYTHING off my ipod
 then tells me the film isnt downloaded
 its on 0kb of 1.3gb
 dronix: my mum got a xmen on dvd for christmas
 you can still recover your files from your ipod
 came with a serial you can enter on itunes
 ah ic
 its fucking done it again
 don't you have your music and playlist in itunes though?
 music; no because everytime i copy it in
 it duplicates everyhting like 4 times
 http://i46.tinypic.com/24nnz2r.png
 ah, you must have set up to automatically sort your folders, I have it on manual
 that's what itunes does for ~10 minutes
 "downloading"
 when theres nothing to download
 I can't pause it, can't stop it
 have to wait for it to stop doing whatever the hell it is really doing
 omg that's a joke
 ...
 u running latest version? I've never had any pbs with itunes
 it's just worked
 HEre is a question people!
 do you think its wrong that I'd marry the man I love ?
 no
 it's no more "wrong" than a regular marriage
 I don't believe in marriage
 it's still 2 people who love each other, making a serious commitment
 :)
 exactly
 watching Tyra banks
 the genders of the people should change nothing
 Basically
 everytime someone makes an argument about gay mariage
 they use the bible
 yet
 the bible has errors everywhere
 in the US isnt state and religion sperate? :P
 organised religon is a bad idea imo
 bible is only toilet paper
 hehe
 eugh
 its funny
 how do i roll back my ipod
 cos like
 to the last time it was synched
 restore button
 majority of white voting americans are catholic
 need to download old firmware Pie`
 and oppose gay marriage
 thusss
 theres no chance if it falls to government
 gay marriage is banned in most states in america
 yup
 I know
 I've told my friends who live in Venice in CA
 I wont move there to work
 until prop 8 is ditched
 I dont want to pay tax to a state that doesnt see me as equal
 Tim: Good luck. California is a really fucking backwards state
 actually
 They let you shoot people if they enter your home -.-
 Ages 21-30 89% voted no to prop 8
 Tim: you'd be really screwed if you were black :p
 so my genration agree with me
 I know right
 People are claiming gay is the new black
 even though american is "against racism" it's still very racist in general
 some black christian said
 Indeed.
 "Thats wrong you dont get hung for being gay:
 ERrr
 yes
 yes we do :P
 goverment is just a load of BS imo :D
 Anarchist :P
 LOL
 "free speech everyone! but say anything nasty and we'll arest you"
 somone on this show said
 government is just an uniform
 "You cant choose to be black but you choose to be gay"
 rofl
 Twins prove gay is very much hormonal genetics ;)
 thats what you call freedom
 identical twins were used
 one gay
 one straight
 although whoever said that does have a point
 being gay is mostly just feelings
 being black is physical appearance
 certain hormone activated genes proved you are both born gay and it is reinforced with environment
 well
 you cant choose to be gay pie
 I tell you now
 I dont find woman attractive at all
 how can you not ?
 not one bit
 I just see them as people
 Tim: more for me :D
 dont want to be with them
 feel nothing for them
 i meant, how can you not choose to be gay
 dont see them as attractive
 you dont choose
 haha
 people have tried to choose not to be gay pie
 Dude
 if we could choose
 we wouldnt be gay
 its not worth the shit we get
 haha
 I guess its different per person
 I'm sure there are a lot of raging homos out there who love being gay ;)
 Im not one of them
 I dont act like a queen
 nor attract attention to myself
 you wouldnt know I was gay if you met me :P
 Thank god Tim you are not a Drag Queen :p
 haha
 fuck that seth
 robert i got through
 haha
 Those folk are a bit messed up in the head I reckon
 like on this show
 but this is for my subdomain what about my new domain
 they sat in gay and straight sides
 tim what are your thoughts on trannies? Do you see yourself doing that?
 I said
 if I was there I would sit in the straight side
 then ask for the mic
 and say
 If you've added the new domain proberly it will look identical to your subdomain
 They're the same thing now
 Im actually gay, now whats different from what you saw 5 secs ago when you thought I was straight? :P
 Haha
 Dronix
 good idea tim
 Im a man
 who loves men
 I dont want a vagina you fool
 I think a lot of people oppose homosexuality just because apparently everyone else does
 they don't actually have a reason to
 people dont realise
 marriage
 Well its been embeded in their thoughts by the media.
 and holy matromony are different things ;P
 media is lies Seth ;)
 Mostly
 do not believe the bullshit they shovel to you
 I like how chrsitiasn say its christian to marry
 but dont attack athiest straight copuples
 or muslims
 Daily Show, and ONN are actually not heh
 or jews
 etc
 yeah
 ONN is totally true
 Ready this is brill
 Im a german born boy of jewish decent and Im gay
 HAH
 +Seth <3 ONN & Daily Show
 all the bad stereotypes in one person :P
 I get alot of shit
 haha
 poor Tim :(
 At least you're not black though, that'd be even worse discrimination
 I don't hate germans
 theres no reason to
 me neither
 people hate germans because of the nazis
 unless they wear swastikas on their arms ;-)
 "nazis were in germany, so all germans must be nazis!"
 eh, nazism isn't /all/ bad
 or at least hitler wasn't
 No, not really. But it isn't all that good either
 ok some of the stuff he did wasn't exactly justified
 but everyone has the odd cockup ;)
 from 1930-1938
 germany was the most advancing country :P
 before the anit jew policies
 hehe
 hitler got germany out of an enourmous depression
 its shame it went to far
 oh h
 yeah*
 gave the majority of the population jobs
 the german economy was on an ENOURMOUS rise
 True, true.
 The mass killing of millions of Jews was a bit... uneeded, however?
 wow
 restoring my ipod
 did fuck all
 (N)
 poor Pie` :(
 I do think the anti-nazism that's still in Germany is a bit far
 Fine, learn from your mistakes
 unless I picked the wrong backup ;)
 But there are some things where it's still to far
 did you know theres more nazis in poland than anywhere else in the world
 Having said that, I now can't tihnk of a good example
 and theyre all football thugs ;)
 didn't know they played football in poland

 Tim: why do you smoke ?
 there's no real benefit from smoking
 the downside to jailbreaking your ipod is itunes doesnt back it up when you plug it in :p
 is there php5.cgi script installed 
 or if it did, i stopped my ipod form syncing
 'cause ima fool :p
 Why do I smoke?
 started at 13
 when I was homeless
 cant remeber why
 other kids I lived in the hostel with I think
 didn't know you were homeless :3
 Pie
 I have had a rough life :P
 I dont talk about it cos it hurts :P
 but then theres a lot i don't know about you
 grrreat
 theres alot no one knows haha
 I have to re-download like
 70 apps again
 unless :o
 Pie`: Thats why you should sync ;-)
 if i sync with itunes applications, ill just need to jailbreak it again :D
 thing is Seth: a lot of my settings etc were from jailbroken stuff ;D
 I'll have to fix that tomorow/today
 aaaaaaand now itunes has crashed, woot!
 Night #zymic
 Go on! Be off with you Ed

 Why do people sam Mam like Marm
 its Mam
 like ham
 or jam
 Mam?
 not mam like harm
 yes
 like
 "yes mam"
 ma'am
 Oh, then ma'am
 pronounced the same way, same meaning, different spelling
 Tim: Madam, Madame, ma'am, or Mme is a title for a woman.
 I'm guessing thats what the "marm" came from
 I mean Ma'am
 hehe
 its pronounced Mam
 like ham
 yeh
 but people here in the UK keep saying
 MARM
 like harm
 :|
 weird
 marm is posh :p
 mam is northern
 "me mam... etc"
 mum, mom -> mother here, mum is rarely used though
 i say mum
 I have northern roots, but they're all gone now
 moved south when i was 2
 or "mommy" with small children
 Pie
 I say Ma' :P
 heh :p
 Im very eastern english
 Southerners here say Ma'

 %u â½
 U+203d interrobang (â½)
 ah
 %u ü
 U+00fc latin small letter u with diaeresis (Ã¼)
 umlaut :3
 yea
 not sure why they say diaeresis
 %u u with umlaut
 Seth: Sorry, no results for 'u with umlaut'.
 doesnt even come up fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
 its not a u with diaeresis
 it is a diaeresis
 complain to unicode
 In linguistics, diæresis, diaeresis, or dieresis, is the pronunciation of two adjacent vowels in two separate syllables
 ü is ue
 in german if you can't get ü, you change it to ue
 for example Führer -> Fuehrer

 THE LAPTOP'S KEYBOARD DIED D:
 Could be worse, laptop keyboards are awful
 ;_;
 Hi.
 benbenbenbenben :D
 Because they're always low-profile, low haptic-feedback, compacted messes ;)
 tssk this laptop was awesome, untill mom let lil bro use it...
 But this laptop isn't really used as a laptop much
 after a week it was missen the enter key, and 30% of the keyboard didn't response :P BOO
 It's just a desktop that I can fit in a backpack for when I go to and from uni on the train.
 i'm using my pc's keyboard now, wireless FTW
 Got wireless keyboard/mouse, external speakers, and an external monitor (which is in addition to the display of the laptop rather than replacing it)
 It is basically just a desktop given how I use it :p
 geesh rub it in alex! mean bastard :P
 Heh, I've had more over the top setups than that
 Alex: You lacking a license/
 My /actual/ desktop (which isn't in use just now) can be used with four displays.  I've had that set up with three before.
 Jacob, license?
 car...
 car license....
 or a car.
 Driving license, right.  I've got a provisional, I keep intending to get around to getting the full one
 gimme the car, alex can have the license, kay thnx
 But no, I don't have a full driving license.
 I see.
 I thought the train was the whole in thing of there. :P
 Harry Potter and shit always get the train so I thought you all did
 o.O
 lol 
 I don't really know how I'm meant to take a judgement on a country based on a fairly crap childrens series.
 Either way, I honestly thought the UK was all trains.
 And sub ways
 The UK train system is crap mate ;)
 Most expensive in Europe, and very poor on reliability
 I wish we had lots of trains. :(
 in here people are addicted to bike's>_>
 Yes we are
 :-D
 I know, you have proper bike lanes all over, Dolleh
 Which means it's actually fairly safe to cycle :p
 ya I guess so
 Screw that shit though
 Whereas we have a few patches of cycle lane, constantly merging in and out of driving lanes
 Not to forget bus stops ;)
 The only reason I take the train is because it saves my parents money.  Because if they're coming up they stay the night in York.
 So that they're only in the car for 4-5 hours each day ;p
 I don't enjoy it, it's boring as hell, my train is /always/ late reaching the destination (in both directions)
 4am, bedtime.
 night jacob
 taxi FTW!
 so expensive tho ben ;_;
 Who said you have to pay ? ;)
 not everybody threatens a taxidriver ben ;)
 :(
 ben I will have my baby back tomorrow :D

 Where'd you get it from Ben?

 lol
 what OS u gona install on it ?
 ?
 Amazon, although I did use a voucher which I had which took the price down to £35 which is why it's so cheap.
 Not going to install any OS on it.
 oh its external, 
 :P
 forgot :)
 Aah 
 Although Amazon do have this thing atm, an Amazon card and when you get it, it gives you £15 or something on it which is what i was going to do but have to be 18.
