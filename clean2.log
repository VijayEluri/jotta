 I forgot what username I regsitered on the free webhosting so I can't recover my acc because it goes by username ;_;
 what can I do?
 do you know the email?
 yeah
 type /msg outlet <email here>
 because I thought I hadn't registered, tried to register an account and it said my email has already been used
 and that sends username etc. to my email?
 no ill look it up
 ur username is "Pie"
 Ah.
 lol
 rob you havent happened to have started phpsteve?
 if this hasn't been done already, you might want to ban the account 'youcanplay'
 Saw wasn't really worth it, although i couldn't leave without going on it.
 Was a good day though concidering only cost me £7
 Pie`: why?
 And on what domain?
 Account info has been shared on a 'hacking site'
 http://www.zymic.com

 Jack, that's up to you I suppose
 Def up to you
 Doesn't appear to be legit, nevermind Andrew.
 Yea it doesn't, I just tried also
 Was just going to change password to something random
 Just send a email to the person telling them
 http://www.google.co.uk/search?rlz=1C1GGLS_en-GBGB311GB311&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=399,999,999,999,999+-+399,999,999,999,998
 google fail
 Sad...
 I see why that works, o at least probably
 because of integer limit, the largest value an integer can be in a computer is 2.147bn (And some extra digits in the middle)
 it works with any number of the 1 i gave you
 - 400,000,000,000,000 doesn't work either :P
 also http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&q=333333333333335+-+333333333333334&btnG=Search
 because of integer limit, the largest value an integer can be in a computer is 2.147bn (And some extra digits in the middle)
 ....
 lol
 wtf does 2.147bn mean
 don't tell me bn = billion
 Because that's the only thing that comes to mind
 And it's not in a computer, it's only certain programming languages that have these limits (or even just the variable type being used depneding on the language) that is limiting this.
 whatever :P
 but thats the onyl reason I can think off
 of*
 But i am wrong :(

 Apparently, Calculators like Google Calc use floating point arithmetic to handle these calculations. In the case of Google Calc they're using double precision floating point arithmetic

 look properly*
 brandon: those bikes on the pic are form the police :P we have police on bikes here XD
 from* typo
 Dolleh
 ruben
 a friend of mine got pulled over and fined
 with his car
 by a police officer on a bike
 We have motorbike officers, and officers riding horses
 i told him to just speed away is what i would do tehre is no way they could catch up
 I don't see them on push bikes though
 lol
 But then, you're better suited for bikes
 Proper cycle lanes everywhere
 we got police: in cars, motors, horses, bikes, skates even, and even quads :\  
 I think we do have quad bikes in the police force
 heh, the horses are useless, my dad was in London and this police woman on a horse was chasing some guy and the guy jumped over the railing... the horse couldn't follow without going all the way around. My dad being the good Samaritan pinned the guy though until the police woman arrived, but yeah, not exactly a great mode of transport. :-p
 For chasing people offroad I think :p
 We have bikes as wekk
 lol XD
 we have cops on quad bikes
 :D
 US have police on segways?!
 i want a segway

 Bread will kick your arse btw
 Crap, Jack isn't here! :(
 Nope
 'Sup Juw?
 damn you taxman
 i have to pay up 2k
 My birthday is in one hour Brandon!
 So is Jack's :)
 :O
 (on my timezone)
 :/
 `time Juw
 Time for Juw is: Sat May 02 22:45:50 2009
 :p
 1 hour and 15 minutes, aight
 "aight" ?
 Jacks is just a litte long than that :p
 your not northern
 (UK ofc)
 you can't say aight..
 Yes I can Pie`
 Lies..
 I just did, right? :)
 anyways, Joyeux anniversaire, Juw.
 !english Pie`
 Pie` any reason for the '`' ?
 None at all, Brandon.
 Juw: Happy birthday in french
 Brandon, they always do that on my website and competitors.
 I know Pie`
 Zymic is full of brits <3 :p
 Well, IRC nothing else haha
 :o
 pfft, juw aint alone
 Many tea drinkers :o
 juw, ik ga je pas feliciteren over een uur XD
 tea is awesome..
 tea FTW!
 see, even the duthc people drink it Juw!
 Coffee gtw.
 ftw*
 I don't like coffee, too bitter...
 Pie`, ofc, I drink tea too
 Just not that much as you brits :)
 juw, would you liek some tea for your b-day then? :D
 Well, I drink a lot on my job though
 like*
 Wow, youtube supports 1080p HD.
 They have very nice free tea :O
 even though ti says it doesnt :D
 Pie`
 it's not 1080p
 Nah Dolleh, I want money :)
 okay!
 For my "King's SR fund"
 Ruben, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylii55gPTbo&fmt=22
 1080p, I uploaded it myself.
 how much? million or 2? or 5 maybe?
 Pie`
 youtube encodes to 20fps
 and <1mbit bitrate
 50 would do fine, so I can buy a set of angel eyes for my Aprilia SR  :)
 1080p is ALWAYS 25fps
 according to the standards
 50,00 
 I think it would be more than 20, as the human eye can see upto 24 fps so we woul see it a bit jittery
 not mil
 if you want true 1080p hd
 try vimeo
 if you have a plus account there
 it will two-pass encode
 it would only be true if I was streaming the video through HD output ;)
 which gives like 40% better quality at same bitrate
 ahw looks pretty pie!!
 VGa/DVI != HD
 dvi is digital
 still not hi-def
 same signal as hdmi therefore you can buy those interchange things
 it sure is
 but right now I couldn't see it in proper 1080p, because the video output on ym graphics card is DVI(and a VGA) which I plugged into my tv's VGA port
 so a DVI -> VGA signal wouldn't show as full 1080p, and also my tv only supports upto 1080i ;)
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Visual_Interface#Specifications
 read about resolutions thnings there
 dvi is VERY suited for hd
 except for the fact it doesn't transmit audio
 which is why newer ati cards have hdmi out WITH audio
 my motherboard has HDMI out :p
 well
 i doubt you'd want your cpu to decode 1080p video
 sure, it can but that's what graphics cards are for
 Mozilla/4.0 (PSP (PlayStation Portable); 2.00)

 TheOracle its true, ask Alex
 @ Banjo
 Lies rebel.
 ^ doin it again
 Pfft
 Alex, ain't it no more than a hoax?
 I mean, I've never heard of bouncewith.me.uk
 Plus, I copied the News ID over to the BBC and got a 404
 http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/europe/8027043.htm
 TheOracle: it's because it is fake
 http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8027043.stm
 that's the real article, nothing to do with zombies
 Yes, I knew that, was tring to explain to banjo its a hoax :P
 :O
 and another fact is they link to Similar to a scare originally found in Cambodia back in 2005,
 but they use archive.org
 I didn't even open the page.
 http://web.archive.org/web/20050428004220/http://65.127.124.62/south_asia/4483241.stm.htm

 :/
 Keep that to yourself love, dronix may get some ideas ;)
 xD
 Hurts to breath this morning
 cant turn my neck either
 I'd imagaing it does :p
 http://www.mawaly.com/file/play/10930.html
 Can someone help me
 is it about hosting, Jordan ?
 Well yes
 shall i join hosting
 then join #hosting
 hi i am having problems logging into PHPMyAdmin
 #hosting
 thats odd
 Rebel you there
 hello
 hello anyone there?
 Jack, want this for another free template http://crownstyles.com/port/GeekSite/ ? .. Not sure if its worth me calling it a template xD
 Brandon, that could be a great template, just needs a background really
 possible some other stuff
 possibly*
 Yea, much more is needed but I can't be asked with it :p
 Lol :)
 I've been working on a site for a while now
 Started off really well but I just got more and mroe bored of it :|
 Was going to eb some kind of elaborate pastebin, with a community etc. built into it
 I'm not sure if I already sent this to J@ck http://crownstyles.com/port/cc/ but probaly have :p
 eb ?
 users "suggest" scripts and admins alow them to be passed if they're good enough
 be *
 Oh yea :p
 Doesn't sound like a pastebin then, sounds more like a resources site
 I guess so.
 The drag in that would be moderation
 A sizable script, you can only really check so much of the code quality
 And make an estimation of the rest
 Because, well, code audit is not something you do for free :p
 was only a project anyway
 wasn't going to be anhting huge
 anything*
 I quite like the idea, it just needed something to make that stage workable at scale
 Oh and also, whena  script is posted it acctually creates the file :D
 writes it to a "secret" directory
 Aye, below the document root
 Then you can serve it back with force-download
 mhmm
 and I only allow downloads when the download button is pressed
 Limiting to a single file has sort of killed the idea for me though :p
 so you can't link directly to it
 http://www.valuemyweb.com/value_report/30007-reporta81bd8c135d4b8f4a58b6c1890f3ca86 < Is it really worth that? ;o
 it says google is worth $29bn
 O_o
 :p
 (h)
 how come urlencode('test'); does nothing?
 rui
 Because there's nothing to encode there?
 "test" in a URL is "test"
 I must have mis-understood what urlencode does :D
 how many people oO
 a little question. on free hosting i can't off safemode, right?
 [14:36:04] <@Pie`> !bin2hex test

 Mine went when Adam made me drop my nick :(
 Made you?

 Well no make me, but told me how to group nicks wrong.
 Ah, you did it the wrong way around
 Yep.
 He said he was sure it was the right way.
 lol of cours he was
 yea pretty sure adam was the one who made me lose my nick and all my channels
 lame
 adam hates everyone
 Lol he was Andrew, I remember both of you dropped your nicks.
 I lost all my channels too and all my ops and stuff
 it was annoying
 heard of /ns help?

 ^
 You were here before me

 hey
 zup
 hey
 :(
 Sometimes I hate apple
 Really?  I thought you'd gotten to the point where that had become physically impossible :p
 I mean, you've started liking obj-c, how much worse can it be ;)
 They revoked my distrobution cert without telling me
 so now I have to manually revoke all my other certs
 then make them all again
 :@
 If they removed yours, then would they not just do it again?
 they removed everyone with access to beta 4
 each time a new beta is given to us
 are certs are null and void
 Heh, sounds like a fun incentive to be part of the beta programme
 *sigh* back again
 Alex the dev portal is awful
 Hi Dolleh
 hey timmie :D
 and how did it went with eating?
 This is just a registry file which inserts a valid key + registrant name into your registry under windows, this will only work if you already have mirc installed :)
 oops
 I managed chicken and pastah Dolleh
 Garlic bread was too tough
 :(
 I don't like Garlic bread anyway
 well great to hear you could manage chicken and pasta already :D
 well garlic bread, maybe you better waith with that, that def hurts <_>
 Nickalerts.com :-p -- Silly wheat based food.
 Heya Dolleh, sorry about earlier, I lost signal.

 Why thank you.

 BANJO!!! YUR FAULT!!
 :(
 haha I've finished this http://www.2flashgames.com/fullscreen.php?id=2290
 i cant get passed the bathroom
 haha its a piss easy game
 Bread: it is unfortunate that you picked an actual word as a handle really :p
 And you can't really switch back to an actual name, because.. "ed" turns up quite a lot too, and some clients do like to nick alert on partial word matches
 Ed, Edd, and Eddy
 We shall see ;-)
 Bred
 Nope, no nick alert
 That's alright then, that could work
 !voice
 Toast left :-p
 Toast is gone.
 Lol
 EdwardCradockAKABread Would be extra safe ;)
 Did not work :D
 I'll pass on that one Alex ;-)
 I think "and" would be a good nick name :D
 thats why you need something unique, like water
 :D
 Hello and
 Most words in the English language turn up eventually if you wait long enough
 hmm
 Banjo hasn't :D
 I went to the zoo and then I did this and then I did that and I hate jelly and ice cream and pickles

 hippy on a bus, sees a nun and goes over to her, he asks her to have sex. the nun replies that she's married to god and gets off the bus. the bus drive sas if you want to have sex with her go to the graveyard every night at 12, but dress up as god. hippy goes to the graveyard that night dressed as god, sees the nun and says "i'm god, i want sex", nun says ok, but asks for anal as she wants to keep her virginity, so they go ahead and when they finish, th
 and when ever someone does a refund
 My phone can go into the toilet and still function
 e hippy says "ahaa im the hippy".. the nun replies "ahaa im the bus driver"
 you have to refund 100% of the paid amount
 while apple still gets their commision fee
 (which is non-refundable)
 so you lose money when ever someone wants a refund
 No ruben I mean custom as in developed and distrobuted using adhoc certificates

 TWO of those
 and they were huge
 yes their very HUGE indeed o_0
 liek you couldn't bite into them
 properly anyway
 yes indeed XD
 (i could do it)
 that's not healthy
 :O
 (i have a very big mouth)
 really..^
 (i eat lots)
 how do they make them Ruben?
 i.e. did you see them making them ?
 I have a big mouth as well, but no way I can do that o_0
 yes
 cant* *cough*
 grilled ?
 rebel they have huge pieces of meat hanging there
 grilling while you're there
 and they cut off the slices in front of you
 ah IC
 on coal ?
 cut the salads in front of you
 i don't remember
 it's all done very well
 yes, coal
 not at all in a fastfood kind of way
 but it's fast took him like less than 2 minutes to prepare
 i went back for a second
 it's not supposed to be fast food
 last friday we went for a picnic and grilled kebabs and all kinds of stuff
 nice :D
 I bet our kebabs are much tastier that yours
 defenitly..
 you could have invited us :(
 next time I will, but you have to come
 :D
 it's Turkish btw
 yus, me knows
 rebel
 it originates from israel
 to be exact
 since crashing my eyes are yet to change colour
 they normally change with the time of day / light levels
 then migrated to Syria, then to lebanon palestne and Jordan
 Been stuck on dark grey for two days now :(
 Ruben: HELL NO!
 o_0 damn tim
 Ruben: unless you mean Palestine, but still not true
 Normaly they will change to a dark blue or green/brown through the day
 brb
 my eyes are gray with brown which
 sometimes makes people think they're red when the sun is shining into them
 one time
 a priest or what ever said i was possessed by the devil at the hotdog stand
 :D!
 XD lolk
 lol*
 mine are just... boring :(
 in the winter dark dark dark brown, near black
 in summer ligth brown
 thats all :\ 
 BORING
 back
 wb
 that's not boring
 mine glow in the dark
 I have the darkest brown eyes ever
 My eyes have over active melanin
 I KNEW dronix was from mars!!!
 the pigmentation thing
 Tim you'll alwasy sick
 dronix
 its not an illness
 its just genes fool
 xD
 oh, ok, then I guess it cool
 melanin is pigmentation
 so when over active they can change colour quickly
 within a few hours of light in my case
 other than that I am boring
 nothing else special about my body
 I like dark brown eyes, but not to have, cause everything around my face is brown already :\  
 mine still glow in the dark
 maybe I should dye my hair red! WOOT! \

 Brandon people dont know how I make money ;)
 dronix: slut :p
 Tim :p
 lol wtf

 This will be fun
 I will get asked a million questions about iphone shit now :(
 uff :(
 thats wh its soo annoying moose
 Tell him you're bi. :p
 I think you like the attention Tim, why r you making such a big deal, just tell'em its none of their business
 dronix: HAHAH
 Mr know it all now ;)
 Dronix you are a fool
 lol wtf 
 lol
 That doesn't work
 And why are you set to away :s
 Alex, me? :p
 The more you tell people to leave you along the more inclined they are to ask Droniz
 Dronix*
 No, telling people it's none of their business
 cus I'm going to work in 10 m
 :)
 I've been telling people I don't use Windows for ages, has done absolutely nothing to stop more questions about Windows crap
 Normaly its easy to work online I have a million usernames and my real name is common
 I get that from Banjo always asking about linux!
 Well, not so much now.
 I haven't used Windows for ages*
 didnt help getting mentioned on a tech site though that got people at school to my personal site :/
 then you get people asking about what I use it for ect
 I'd rather keep the two seperate
 When I go do this talk in London I won't be telling people its on founding startups ect I will say I am going shopping
 Haha
 my schools website is soooo poor
 same here
 it looks like a grenade hit it
 Though, it does help that I now charge by the call-out in pints from people I know
 But I dont want to be known ad the person to ask to do it Rico
 I expected that to slow things down, but all it's done is get me more pints
 Win-win situation
 not as bad as mine
 i have no choice but to do it over
 Alex I charge money instead
 Works much better
 slows things down and you can buy pints and have some left over
 [21:28:43] <Rico> my schools website is soooo poor
 No such thing as mates rates here I'm affraid
 my school ahs poor security
 I asked my art teacher for hes password, she gave me it
 I thought about that, but decided it was too much of a git's way out ;)
 now i have access to everything I could ever need
 http://www.foundationosa.org/SCHOOL.HTM lol plz dont laugh
 I can take my name off detention registers, Mark myself in for school, I've got the school wireless key
 Good for you, you are aware if you use that access it's still illegal
 http://www.kesgrave.suffolk.sch.uk/
 CACK
 lmfao wow.
 Rico wins :"
 http://www.magdalen.northants.sch.uk/cms/
 my site
 schools*
 lol
 I saw frames and quit
 and if u want some lulz
 https://home.mcsbrackley.co.uk/
 user: tammyf pass: ruby2000
 the funny thing is the icon templates the used on my schools site
 http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/ that's mine ;)
 are iphone templates made by a close online chum of mine xD
 your site is great compared to my schools
 but Rico, did your school do their own site, or did they pay
 So, Alex how're you ?
 My school is made by a teacher
 Not bad, you?
 i'm not gona show off my school :\ 
 it was a free job
 cause its fugly V_V
 Good, I'm just fine thanks :)
 They're going to have to pay soon in the UK
 http://www.pixelhorizon.co.uk/   <-- did my schools template
 Who want to make me and op in #zymic. I mean I was in a car crash.... ALEX :D
 Ermm
 It's going to be a requirement soon that all schools have a website which allows parents & pupils access to resources, results, etc
 Who wants to make me OPER on irc.zymic.com kai? I broke a finger nail :(
 No brandon
 I've read the stuff they sent out to the schools about it
 ADAM SUCKS
 Well no
 I love him really
 ... Coming from the bi.
 xD sorry timmeh :p
 But eww I have to be hop with Crown
 :O
 who wants to give me VOICE!!
 near 5 years of service and no op
 yeah
 Service?
 Haha
 Lol
 sitting here being a fool :D
 Tbh we have many ops and few ops
 and now tom is gone
 My name is close
 Alex: if you have the choice to be study computer science, computer engineering, graphic design, psychiatry, architecture  ... what would you choose ?
 if i disconnect my voice will be taken away??
 and I have the same BDay, you know it makes Sense Alex
 :)
 Rico, are you black?
 So does Jack
 Um... given I'm doing Software Engineering, what do you think, rebel? :p
 But he hates me for being a tractor boy
 lol yea pie`
 architecture
 I know Alex, but what if you have the chance to rechoose from the things I said
 I do still have a choice, I could switch, but I'm not
 mmmmmmmm
 whay ?
 why * ?
 Because I don't want to do the others?  They're quite different apart from Computer Science
 And I just already know I'm not interested in hardware, thus, the CSSE pathway which drops all the hardware from year three
 I mean, what makes you choose computer science? like what
 like what's interesting about it *
 O CRAP
 more than the others
 brb I gotta play the perfect daughter
 Technology is interesting, I derive a lot of satisfaction from completing projects, improving a solution I already have, or solving a specific problem.  I want to get into Software Engineering because it balances that part of it against some of the more people-oriented aspects
 And its more employable ;)
 is it ?
 any one know how do releive chest pain
 This is killing me
 I thought graphic design is
 Since you likely end up managing projects, but not as a clueless manager type, you still get to do actual thinking ;)
 Oh Alex I meant to ask! How's the job prospect at that place your dad is connected to?
 Any luck yet?
 I'm asking because after 1 year I'll have to make this decision, and I'm really confused, I like programing I like designing, I'm interested in psychiatry......
 He forgot to ask the last time he spoke to people there >_>
 Ouch
 Haha write him postits
 put the everywhere
 Hard to do from York, Tim :p
 Look where Daniel is going: http://wheresdaniel.info/wiki/index.php/Main_Page
 :(
 what ???
 rebel: I'd certainly be employable :p
 so when do i get permanent voice??
 I'm getting a degree from one of the best Computer Science departments in the country.
 And then Alex will work for me at YummyCocoa
 on a massive sallery
 :)
 2k per anum sound okay ?
 It'd have to be to deal with obj-c :p
 Haha, nah
 Haha
 No it would be around 50k before tax
 Alex: software engineering is different that computer science right ?
 Gah linkinus fails
 brb
 :O
 In some places it's a completely different course
 For me, it's not that different, you could get a similar course taking vanilla computer science and picking modules
 :O I just got a kernal warning
 Hmm
 I just prefer opting in and having my degree say "Computer Science and Software Engineering"
 not quite a panic but somthing is up
 Alex what would genrally lead to a panic?
 Could it be a major mem leak?
 Any fatal error, Tim
 Mine turn Alex <3
 Hi guys
 Is anybody here?
 yes
 I really need help installing my "mybb" forum
 http://www.voltagecommunity.co.cc
 that is my website and i get an error when I try to install it... http://www.voltagecommunity.co.cc/forum/install/index.php
 can you tell me the error ?
 yes
 Error  There seems to be one or more errors with the database configuration information that you supplied:      * Could not connect to the database server at 'localhost' with the supplied username and password. Are you sure the hostname and user details are correct?  Once the above are corrected, continue with the installation.
 your database details are wrong
 if you join #hosting they can help you out
 :)
 i recreated a new one
 let me check if it works
 It not work!
 it problem with zymic
 are you using the right username ?
 yes
 There is a limitation on username length
 I used
 How long is the one you're trying to use?
 database name: voltagecommunity_n1
 User name: voltagecommunity_n2
 Pass: *****
 so.. what to do :( ?
 The limit is 16 characters, which is unfortunately the length of your username
 If you make an account with a shorter username, and make a database there, that should work
 ahh
 Ok Alex
 Thank you very much bro

 the younger they are the tighter they are around your d***
 Bahaha

 timmie! :D
 how did xray stuff go?
 It didnt
 fecking hostpital
 Im in tomorrow at 5:30
 pm
 Heh, nice
 The hospital near me is new, so they're usually not bad, my GP is an idiot though, I've had to go there a few times 'cuz he screwed up
 Oh dear, what did he scew up on?
 Things like taking blood for tests, and forgetting that one of the tests required fresh blood, so it was too old by the time they got it there.  This was back when they were looking for causes of my migraines.
 So, his next suggestion was that they'd take the blood and then give it to us, and we could drive to the hospital and give it to them... They needed it within 30 minutes of taking it, we went to the hospital and had them do it :p
 Hah, what was causing the mirgraines?
 They never worked out a reason
 :o
 Could be a tumor or something silly :p
 Nah, I had my brain scanned >_>
 :p
 That wasn't much fun
 Did you have to go in one of them big round things ?
 They fix your head in place, because you can't move, and so you lie there completely still for about half an hour
 While the person meant to be monitoring stuff goes off to have a fag or something
 Hahah, should of got up and messed around with the computer or something.
 Thing about those machines as well, they're bloody loud
 Doesn't help if you have a migraine, right? :p
 Well, yeah, but I didn't at the time, it was just annoying
 If I had had one at the time, I wouldn't have been there.  Wouldn't like to end up chucking up in the machine or something
 No that would not been nice
 be*
 tweet twwet + apple = garbage
 :O
 :S
 Dronix was there any point?
 gossip about apple buying twitter, haven't you heard?
 Thats all it is gossip
 I block certain things shwoing up though
 What would Apple want with a website that is only surviving on venture capital?
 'Garbage' is what I was more worried about *evils*
 Alex, No idea what you just said :p
 Alex I'm sure they see somthing in it.
 no idea either
 Maybe an addition to mobileMe
 Status' from the iPhone
 $700m is quite a sum
 Not for apple
 Brandon: it's not making profit, the only reason twitter has money because venture capital investers keep giving it to them :p
 Oh I see
 You have to remeber large corps find that not very much at all
 Especially when making tens of billions
 is because*
 I'm sure apple have a viable reason
 There is some history in bigger companies buying out websites like these, but their long-term aim is always profit.
 Yeah
 I mean most of the successful iphone apps are twitter apps
 so its making them money allready
 yeah I'm sure they have a profound reason
 They don't need to own twitter for that though
 to improve and promote the service will be benificial
 If apple bought twitter they would close it off I bet
 because they are assholes like that.
 lol wtf
 I don't see how it's a viable return on investment for them
 Make it so only apple users can use it
 windows fan boy is hating again
 Andrew they're will be a clause preventing that
 there*
 I am happy that google didn't get it
 Doubt it, Twitter doesn't care that much about users :p
 I'm kind of tired of google trying to own everything also
 WTH
 I hate that I use them for email, but I love the gmail interface
 I think I have dislocated my finger
 They've gone so far as to say your personal information is an asset of the company, and they are fine with selling it, and sharing it
 :|
 brb
 (actually they already do share it)
 Most companies have better privacy policies than that
 [19:54] <&Alex> Brandon: it's not making profit, the only reason twitter has money because venture capital investers keep giving it to them :p
 Youtube, facebook, etc
 Very silly isn't it
 All of these big sites lose hundreds of millions a year
 Well, Google are trying to monetise youtube
 Not sure they'll manage it
 I think hulu is beating youtube in that reward
 Well bandwidth prices in 5-10 years time will help
 I <3 hulu
 hulu*

 Hi all
 hello
 Only important calendar page ;) http://www.zymic.com/forum/index.php?act=calendar&cal_id=1&code=showday&y=2009&m=11&d=3
 This one is almost as important http://www.zymic.com/forum/index.php?act=calendar&cal_id=1&code=showday&y=2009&m=8&d=13
 I aint on it :D
 *proud*
 <Andrew> @urban Alex <Phot> [URBAN] Alex <Phot> [URBAN] noun.
 ?
 urban dictionary command on a bot.
 Yea, what the heck ;o
 I looked up your name and it said you're a noun.
 All names are proper nouns
 What was so interesting about that :p
 So damn true Andrew: http://grabup.crownstyles.com/98bc520d7c103b9ae865f98b481168f7.png :p
 most of us had cool responces.. you just got noun
 [URBAN] andrew
 [URBAN] Ultra cool, Usually hot or at least sort of cute. Awesome sense of style, music, and humor. Sexy, awesome kisser
 outlet wasn't defined
 Many lies listed there :p
 You didn't argue about the great kissing last night Brandon 
 I know
 Plus, I thought I told you to keep that to yourself? ;[
 <Andrew> Macs are for faggots
 waits to see all the flames come down on Andrew 
 from who
 none of the mac fags are here
 andrew = windwoz fan boy
 And?
 ?
 ??
 :O TIM ADAM WHERE ARE YOU
 being gay with their macs
 Andrew !!
 Go die slag. :p
 andrew is jealous
 Yea, I agree.
 In my opinion I can't justify overpaying for an OS on hardware I HAvE to buy from the OS manufacturer. Everything I can do on mac I can do on windows.
 You guys just have to have it LOOK pretty.
 have it your way
 keep missing out
 That's your only justification for using mac, "I don't want to miss out"
 I'm not missing out on anything by not having a mac
 if there was something on a mac that i REALLY wanted and couldn't get on windows/linux (Not likely)
 apple pie is with out apple is just a pie
 I'd just download a mac iso
 and run it on a vm
 And a house without windows is an insane asylum.
 No.
 I never said you HAD to buy a mac, I think running the os is more than enough, I too agree with not wanting to buy the hardware
 Yea, hardware side sucks =[

 When I can be bovered I'll upgrade my HDD & RAM :)
 Similar spec to my laptop, what'd it cost you?
 Alex, you don't want to know :(
 I will get osx and run in a virtual machine and see if it changes my opinion. If it does I'll apologize. It won't though.
 $2400 brandon?
 Mine cost £400 a year ago
 at least $2000
 ^
 Like, 4 times that Alex ;p
 thats the downside to macs, you can fully customize the hardware
 *can't
 So, what you're saying is
 OSX cost you about £1000 ;)
 On there site its like Â£80 :/
 I think
 lol.. that wasnt alex's point
 Yes, I know
 :P
 I was saying on there site its like Â£80 odd and like why am I paying this much for this crap :p
 Well, I didn't pay for it heh
 Yes, Â£83 :(
 you are better off making a hackintosh
 iirc I got a OSX DVD with mb though so I may try it on pc :p
 I think the reason they are so expensive is because of the design of the macs aswell as the boxes :p
 Other than the price I'm happy with it :p
 I would consider hackintosh my my mobo and processor aren't on the list
 I've yet to learn how to code going to be hard :p
 maybe i'll steal a neighbors computer lol
 Lol
 I'd call you a thief for doing so though
 You're the theif brandon
 You stole my heart
 I'm now tempted to go install on pc :p
 im gonna try it this summer
 Why summer? You've got awhile to go :p
 not really..
 im done school june 13
 12*
 How old are you?
 17
 lol I bet you are counting outlet
 yep..
 No way! you look 12 years old :p
 im not 12..
 he never said you were
 brandon
 he said you look it
 Your mac CD won't work on PX
 PC
 Wont it? :(
 huh?
 I'll see if it works.
 it does work
 Yea, Pie`is right
 no it shouldnt.. ususally requires some patch..
 no, http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=113288
 however thats not the recommended way of installing osx on a pc
 It "can" but only after a modification
 but you could buy whatever comes with a psystar openpc
 well this bootloader allows you to now
 but before it was you had to download a modified dvd
 yeah thats how I tried it on my laptop before getting the imac
 Wait, OSX only works on Intel?
 I think you can make it work on an amd, not sure, my lapop is an amd
 osx86project.org
 ive got an AMD 64
 :D
 thats where I got the guide from
 yeah intel
 Hmm, yea didn't boot up :(
 you need a patch Brandon
 Linkage son
 make sure you hardware is supported: http://wiki.osx86project.org/wiki/index.php/HCL_10.5.6#AMD
 insanelymac and osx86project.org is the same site
 brandon
 http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=113288
 This tells you how to do it
 without downloading the modded osx dvd
 You just need to get their bootloader and burn to a CD
 can't use amd though
 or u can installed the mac os
 then install GRUB
 ??
 might work :/
 GRUB supports everyhting
 even windows 7
 ;D
 Meh, I don't want to install on Intel PC to much work. Its packed down :p
 uuuq is down ?
 no Bread broke it
 but yes
 Where can I get a vhost?
 at the store
 ?!?!?1
 Pie`: You'd have to ask Bread or Alex.

 Bread or Alex how do I rename a file again within ssh?
 mv
 ty sir
 There is rename for renaming multiple files by regex though, but move is all I ever use.
 Heh, just needed it for one file in anycase.
 I really need to remember these.
 you will the more you use them.
 They're basically mnemonics so they shouldn't be too hard to guess.
 I know rm -rf deletes a dir, ls lists everything in dir, del deletes single files, reboot reboots server :p
 Yea
 I use rm for single files
 Like uptime :p
 rm: missing operand
 Heh, I don't even have a del command on mine.
 :p
 Yes, it's rm <file>
 rm does ?
 Ohh
 removes a file
 That's what rm -rf does, recursive forced
 Yea =]
 If you didn't have forced it would ask you if you were sure you wanted to delete the file :-p
 Yea
 I'm not sure how to restart like dns httpd etc.. via ssh though
 Most of those are in init scripts, so /etc/init.d/httpd restart, or sometimes /etc/init.d/apache restart, just explore your /etc/init.d/ directory
 Means logging into root but i cba :p
 Depends on the version of the software too, /etc/init.d/apache2 is what I have on my system.
 Oh really
 You know how to login as root from your shell account, yep?
 Nope?
 "su", I prefer to use "su -" though as it then gains the home directory of root, not the user that executed it.
 oic
 Bread: that's not the only difference
 su - gives you a proper new shell, whereas "su" leaves a lot of stuff from the previous user's session
 yeah, but those don't usually bother me :-p
 Stuff like: http://pastesite.com/6945
 Just for an easy example :p
 I get bash: /bin/su: Permission denied though :/
 you probably need to add yourself to the wheel group
 oic
 as root ls -al /bin | grep su, check the group
 Added
 The the password would be the root password?
 Then8
 *
 Oh
 I went on whm and added myself to it :p
 haha
 oops
 i ment hehe*
 you will need to log out and log back in Brandon for the group to take effect, but yep, that should be it.
 Yep
 But now, when I type just 'su' it asks for a password :p
 yep, that's the root password.
 Yea, I'm on
 I never knew that :p
 only problem is root password is 15chars long and you can't mem it :(
 Alex question for you :p .. How do I add a opper via OS ?
 Or do I have todo it manualy ?
 You have to do that manually, it's a server thing, not a services thing
 Sucks, but ohwell.
 Also, how do I get out of 'su' ?
 exit?
 Heh yea
 I seem to be talking to myself again, I don't enjoy it honestly :p
 poor brandon.. 
 outlet: notice me a password you'd like to use? :p
 did you get it?
 No
 Wait
 Had to be awkward didn't you :p
 :P
 i just put random letters together to fake word
 My dog ran away
 :(
 i saw :(
 Alex, cs_statusonadd what is the one like that for inspircd? I can't seem to find it :p
 i think alex is hiding from you
 just like bread hiding from me
 :O bread why isnt steve here..
 hes got a cron jobs to make him reconnect...\
 Why does he keep disconnecting?
 i dunno.. but its should reconnect.. when the cron job runs
 any one know when he died?
 /home/outlet/steve/cronjob/autostart.sh > /dev/null bread is that correct?
 i'm gona get tea, sorry I murdered steve secretly yesterday :( OOPS
 not me
 cause thats whats in the command box
 outlet: http://grabup.crownstyles.com/25ebffffb6f4d692fd6ccdb1bdfdcbdd.png
 hmm
 hes not connected to anything then..
 A bug you should fix :p
 yeh..
 bread any idea why?
 Brandon any place i can go to see that? 
 See what?
 whatever you screenshoted
 Ermm, not sure..
 alright i killed that process so lets see if he comes back
 ohhh i wonder if its when irc burps he gets d/c and tries to connect but cant?
 there he is.
 so the cronjob works
 :p
 He just doesn't die in proccess
 just something making his connection die.. and the cronjob only works if the proccess is dead
 so lets do this
 brandon would you mind seeing if his process is still active?
 Lol: http://grabup.crownstyles.com/00dd9306dcbdf77fd631e86397ccb3d9.png
 wuts -f do?
 Runs in the background me thinks, Bread?
 :(
 to run in background u can do
 nohup command /args/ & >> file.log
 will log all output to file.log :D
 bread / swordz how can i make steve check if hes been killed from the server..
 cause i just killed him from irc but his process is still goin?
 outlet, if(fread($sock, 128)) == NULL) { //connect } ?
 Oh I was wrong me thinks file.php & runs in bg :p
 well id rather just kill the script so it can be re ran its less likely to screw something up
 outlet, after the while loop put fclose($sock);
 that way if its not reading the script will stop :D
 you could also die() I guess too
 but fclose() will just send the script to the end so it will stop anywya
 okay so right after the while look put that?
 loop* yeah
 because the while loop will never end as long as the bot is connected
 how did you create your while loop?
 http://pastesite.com/6947/stevebot
 okay heres part of steve
 remove while(1) {
 you don't need that
 oh really?
 yeah
 set_time_limit(-1);
 if you stick that in the while loop the execution limit doesnt kick in :D
 where at the top?
 inside while($data ...
 any specific place?
 line 14
 http://pastesite.com/6948/stevebot9yTo
     while($data = fgets($socket, 256)) {
  <-- put set_time_limit(0); here
 alright.. lets head to #test
 once thats tehre you can get rid fo the while(1) loop
 I'm off, cya laters
 later brandon
 Does PHP execute stuff as it gets to it in the file, or would it go back if something chages to make a condition true/false ?
 is there a way to list processes i have running from shell bread?
 ps -ef
 holy crap
 o_0
 lot of processes running
 XD
 alright lets see what happens
 :confused:
 I really want to make a connect() function
 is there a way to list only processes ran under a specific user.. rather than all processes
 so i just can reconnect the bot on a certain action
 there he is :)
 outlet, probably, i just don't know
 now lets see if his process is running
 woohoo thanks Pie` it worked
 :p
 wooot

 sharan, All hosting related questions are to be directed towards #hosting ; to join the channel please type /join #hosting
 shouldnt there not be a space between #hosting and ; ?
 there is

 Pie`: there SHOULD be
 hm that broke
 Otherwise if people click it they will join #hosting;
 sec.
 !part #zymic
 Andrew, I've never seen a space between a word and a semicolon before
 Did you even read what I said?.......................
 Yes becase like he said it will make people join #hosting; if they click it.
 Hover your mouse over #hosting;
 yeah, you said thjere SHOULD be
 (except my irc client it ignores it)
 Yes, there should be....;
  Otherwise if people click it they will join #hosting;
 im saying there shouldnt be a space
 THERE SHOULD BE ADMIT YOUR WRONG!
 WE KNOW
 I'm not saying in real life, but in this damn instance there should be...
 Look basically if there isn't a space then people will join '#hosting;' not '#hosting'
 my client joins #hosting
 me shrugs
 So does mine but other peoples don't.
 Yea but you're not a mibbit user
 screw mibbit :p
 And xchat doesn't ignore the semicolon
 Go die.
 ^ +1
 thats not nice :{
 And you're being annoying
 I can't help the fact that some irc clients dont ignore a symbol which sint allowed in a registered channel name anyway...
 It is too allowed...
 [13:18:10] * Now talking on #hosting;
 if it was then how come mirc ignores it?
 /join #hosting;
 do it
 mIRC is stupid.
 our IRC server allows ; in chan names
 *shrug*
 ugh man, microsoft isn't letting me download windows 7 RC
 it keeps stopping randomly in the middle of the download
 I think it's because my internet is SHIT
 the downloader tool they made you use for build 7000 worked like P2P i think, could stop/start when you wanted
 i think..
 It does, but when it froze I tried pausing it so I could resume it (to try to kickstart it) but it just froze on "Stopping" and wouldn't change to "Stopped" to let me resume
 I left it for about 45 minutes
 I'm just gonna download from torrent
 At least there I can limit my download speed and not completely rape my internet for 12 hours
 My download speed sucks ass. I get about 130kb/s
 :O
 yea so I have uTorrent's scheduler setup, so that it limits my download to 40kb/s so it doesn't slow everything down and it automatically goes to max when everyone is sleeping and when people aren't here.
 hmm that sucks.
 that was odd
 :/
 need some pr0n :o
 I'd ask for link but not so sure anymore.

 Are global variables bad?
 i dont see why they would be
 $GLOBALS['varname'] :D
 Yeh i know but can't remember who said it, might of been Bread or Alex said use a class instead or something. Was just double checking before i use globals (not using php btw, coding c#)
 Are you using preset, or setting your own?
 ah
 probably should use a class instead then
 Making my own
 As they know lots of stuff better than me
 ahh gay :( just more effort lol. Ok i shall use a class then.
 Banjo: I was also told that global vars are bad in js
 I think that was it in the js channel

 how can I remove registred domains in zymic? I have the free ones uuuq.com

 Bread: you cook ?
 Bread is a cheif ;)
 Bread is a very good cook, i remember when he made burgers hmmm ;)
 I love cooking... or at least watching cooking shows
 Werido :p
 because Bread, otherwise people would be asking the question opposite to yours, "Why aren't knifes sharp, they never cut anything"
 thankx for help :)
 Not that bad, hurt like a bitch when I did it though

 A wise Chinese man said... YOU'RE LAME Banjo!
 :(
 XD
 I want to meet this wise Chinese man, he seems a little off
 seems to have Banjo and Bread mixed up ?? :confused:
 lol
 banjo went off, and bread just said goodnight :D
 :P
 my youtube lookup NEARLY works perfect D:
 it messes up though if www. or http:// are missing off the start of the url
 blergh D8 dishes, does the wise chinese man has something for that bread?
 oh nevermind :D
 Afraid not Dolleh. Destroy the  dishes, then there's nothing to wash  :)
 Bread, how many forum moderators does it take a change a light bulb?
 Go on?
 None, there is no light bulb. Thread closed
 :P
 im gona break some dishes then :D
 how many Irish people does it take to change the light bulp ?
 5; one standing on a chair holding the bulb, 4 rotating the chair
 Hah, that's a good one.
 how many Irish people does it take to wash a bus ?
 Mainly because of the imagery it conjures up
 go on?
 0 there is no bus
 100; 1 holding the thing you clean buses with
 like a toil 
 is it a toil ?
 what's a toil ?
 Lost me now
 anyway the other 99 shake the bus
 one person holds a towel 
 towel yes that's it
 you don't clean buses with a towel though
 hrm, you know the first one you said would be better if you said Jews
 how many Jews does it take to change a light bulb.
 none
 5 one to change the bulb and the other four to rotate the chair.
 makes more sense
 nope
 because of barmitzfas or however the hell and their weddings
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrQwymhUV6s&feature=related JEWISH CHAIR DANCE
 none, because someone else will do it for the,
 oops caps
 no
 anyway did you get the last one ?
 1 holding the towel, 99 moving the bus
 How many gay men does it take to change a lightbulb ? 
 Three. One to screw in an Art Deco bulb, and two to shriek, "Fabulous!"
 how many ?
 Deco means ?
 Art Deco is a type of ... umm decorating?
 like Antique
 oh ic
 How many men does it take to screw in a lightbulb ? 
 just u
 Only one. Men will screw anything
 so if an american find a bug in their coffee, what would he/she do ?
 I personally would pick it out
 I'd still drink the coffee, unless it was a roach. Roaches gross me out
 he'd throw the coffee away, what if a british man find a bug in their coffee
 ?
 I don't drink coffee
 LOL andrew that's exactly what I was going to say
 :P
 what if a chinese man finds it ?
 throw the coffee and eat the bug
 haha
 so wait british people don't like roach?
 he'll kick its ass
 a jew ?
 a jew will sell it on ebay
 no they will pick the bug out and drink the coffee 
 no he will sew the shop for being anti semitic, accuse palestinians and ask for $$$ from us 
 first one is @ andrew: so wait british people don't like roach?

 yea
 The BBC link is to an article about a stash of money in Baghdad
 http://safat.info/
 look at the site
 yeh I know
 I probed the email address, usually the first thing I do
 It looks like its an email host
 http://www.gawab.com/webfront/register.php?formAction=start&selDomain=safat.info
 Thats the register link
 i don't think its english either
 http://www.gawab.com/webfront/NewGawab/ar/ar.gif

 It's LCD though
 So at least it's crisp
 so's my 17"
 Better than my old CRT
 heh
 thing with this 22" tv im usin as a montir, is the text is just that little TINY bit furry around the edges
 its a bit noticable
 but its not noticably annoying
 Did you hook it up with svideo
 im usin dvi out from pc into vga
 ahh
 probably why?
 Andrew: same as mine, but not LCD, and with higher resolution..... gonna change it soon
 I have my 22" tv hooked up, but I had to use svideo to rca converter, it's HORRIBLY blurry
 haa.
 I wanna get 2x 22"
 then my screen res would be uh
 (1680x1050)^2

 Zymic abuse
 puya3d.com
 :/
 lol
 joshpelk: Join #hosting plese
 please
 I am on hostinmg
 hostinmg?
 lol ignore it frank :P
 what ever
 Hello
  i need speck administrador zymic site
 join #hosting valentin ;)
 is this an abuse report valentin?
 Anyone know what /me is raw?
 Has anyone ever used SiteFros.com?
 *Frost.com
 Nope
 :p
 what does zymic have currently?
 Yeah, well, I've had it on a list of things to do for a while now, but this IRCd works
 So I don't see the need, if we move hosting shell I probably would
 :p
 Frank: UnrealIRCd
 ok
 The thing is, I don't trust the unreal developers any more
 Why's that?
 Do you have to have that running all the time for irc to work?
 To keep working on it properly, they seem to be flitting around a load
 Frank: yes, of course :p
 Can use your computer if it's off :P
 Same with IRC daemon
 They spent ages working on an Unreal 4.x branch forking from InspIRCd
 Frank: you're going to create an irc netwrok?
 Then all of a sudden they decide nah, we'll drop that
 I wish I could
 I dont know how though
 But while that was going on the 3.x tree sort of stagnated, and a lot of old devs left
 I'm not sure any of the developers who know the current tree inside out are still there
 And now they dropped their planned next version, that's not going to be a viable move, so InspIRCd looks good
 How do you create your own irc network?
 Install an IRC server
 [14:16] Alex: So I don't see the need, if we move hosting shell I probably would <~ Don't see the need of what? Moving zIRC?
 that's a good start
 Need an IRC daemon too
 Changing the server TheOracle
 ic
 TheOracle: of switching this IRCd to InspIRCd from UnrealIRCd
 I dont know anything about irc
 Alex: Isn't InspIRCd the daemon Crown runs?
 Then it's probably best not to start one without reading up first :p
 TheOracle: by my recommendation, yes :p
 lol
 So what do I need to start one?
 <Alex> Then it's probably best not to start one without reading up first :p
 :/
 Well...
 :p
 Well, it's not a simple, install this
 Alot of crap to configure
 You may also want to read the RFC Frank
 To get an idea of how IRC works
 I guess I wont start one then
 it looks complicated
 For the best, IRCds that aren't looked after end up being host to botnet command & controls
 Banjo: I've switched from nettalk :O
 Does anyone know of a irc alternative?
 Using Miranda now
 Frank: Dunno
 Chatroom script?
 I want something just like IRC
 Well, good luck then
 lol
 just setup a channel on a well known IRC server
 Freenode, etc
 I dont know what irc server i should use?
 that's what alot of people do, it's easier because bigger irc networks have MANY servers
 freenode would be a start
 yea
 ok
 What is Freenode?
 irc.freenode.net :/
 What was everyone just talking about? IRC servers :P
 lol
 What server software do i need?
 Uh, what?
 What irc server sytem do i need?
 For your own server?
 yeah
 You'd need a IRCD (IRC Daemon)
 Alex: Unreal is easier to use than inspircd right?
 I personally don't find either complicated :p
 And I have to run that on my computer all the time?
 If you're going to get confused about one, you'll get confused by the other
 Brandon: Why would you ask Alex? He's thinks everything on the internet is easy :P
 Frank: running something like that on your own computer is not a good idea
 Then what do I run it on?
 If you want your own server, you'll want to shell out for an IRCd shell, or a VPS/dedicated server that allows IRC services
 frank
 $10/mo+ as a rough baseline
 We were saying just use irc.freenode.com to have a CHANNEL.
 NOt a whole server.
 ok
 Freenode isn't the best place to setup camp.
 Why not us zymic ?
 Yea, we have hops here. :O
 And voice
 and owner
 Freenode has fairly specific rules about what kind of stuff is allowed to set up channels there
 and +a :O
 It's a free software hangout
 And free projects related to that kind of thing
 Freenode has a system for different levels of staff per channel as well
 orly?
 Just, by policy they prefer that people don't op up except when needed
 So it's mostly transparent as far as the regular users are concerned
 brb
 Interesting exit
 im off for a bit
 Definitely Interesting :-p
 Later on Andrew 
 Not such an interesting Quit
 hello
 i need help plz
 Hosting related?
 yes plz
 join #hosting
 i forgot my web hosting password
 ok
 thank you
 Banjo
 I'm not using Nettalk anymore :O
 Trice: Did you sort out your daddy?
 you are an odd boy:P
 Heh :p
 Really?
 Yea
 :p no. I may do.
 Looking for a tunnel now though
 the world is gonna have to swap to IPv6 soon
 we're "running out" of IPv4 addresses
 Yes
 128 bit addresses waiii :p
 Hideous IP addresses to remember / write though
 2002:0:0:0:0:0:50b0:e6b7
 thats my ipv6 ip
 hey
 is there anybody how can explain me how to get into phpmyadmin?
 move to #hosting
 ok
 Bread: how often do you have to remember an IPv4 IP address off the top of your head? :p
 DNS ftw, and for those odd situations where you don't have that, a notebook will do :p
 :p
 Well not a lot, but if I DID need to ;-)... yeah, I have a hardback book I scribble in
 I might end up moving to a A4 size thing, but for the moment I like having the smaller thing, I can stick it in a pocket
 Anything that means I don't have to lug a backpack around :p
 Back
 Hi i am on the right place to look for help with my Zymic web account?
 join #hosting
 sorry i am new here how dfo i do this?
 Heh, I got given mine when I went to get a job at an antivirus company... waste of time, contract said I wouldn't get paid for the training if I didn't qualify etc... and that was like 4 weeks so I dropped out after first day, kept the book they gave me though ^_^
 Type /join #hosting helpme or click on the name
 helpme type /join #hosting
 hehe nice Bread :D
 Good habit to get into, making lots of notes.  Proper engineering practice
 I'm trying to make myself do it more :p
 My Dad has A4 books of notes going back 20 years or something
 Takes up half the wall of our office back home ;)
 Sure quite a lot of those aren't really relevant any more though
 Haha :p
 Well if it ever comes to it, you can burn them instead of books (The Day after Tomorrow
 HELP!!
 CAN ANYBODY HELP ME???
 I need somebody, not just anybody?
 Oh, apparently not
 Alex
 Are u an admin?
 Shame, thought we had a beatles fan for a second there
 WHO WORKS FOR UUUQ?
 I maintain the IRCd, I don't work with the hosting if that's what you're asking
 ClubDevin: we don't really need the all-caps, it's considered quite rude...
 ClubDevin: Join #hosting we will assist there.
 im sorry
 but i dont want to!
 can somebody just give me some help?
 <Banjo>ClubDevin: Join #hosting we will assist there.
 You were offered help just now, in #hosting
 Also don't just ask for help, we can't help unless we don't know the problem.
 -.-
 Um, Banjo, you mean unless we do know ;)
 Oh yeh my bad :(
 hehe
 nobody is in http://www.mibbit.com/chat/?server=irc.zymic.com&channel=%23zymic#
 type /join #hosting
 sorry
 Let me help out here
 ok well i cant see my site!
 Ok, you should be in #hosting now
 Ooh me thinks Alex used superadmin :O
 o.o
 hehe
 I need assistance please. :)
 If you need help with the hosting, then please join #hosting
 Otherwise ask away :)
 hmm wonder why people don't read the topic.
 I'm not sure which link is getting people here
 The forum has a big "HOSTING help" link above the #zymic one :p
 Yeh, well they might be getting the links from http://www.zymic.com/contact-us/ and http://www.zymic.com/irc/
 oh actually maybe not, there not mibbit links my bad
 It's probably the live chat one in the forum header
 Yep... this one.
 oh yeh
 outlet's creating a gateway page which we'll link them to
 Ah, was that what the zirc logo crap was about :p
 yep
 Nice, should be good :)
 To replace the current zymic.com/irc?
 zirc logo?
 Possibly, would have to check with Jack, but it'll replace the links in the forum for def.
 brandon you broke steve :(
 No?
 yeh.. you said "bye steve"
 Just out of interest who does the coding? http://www.zymic.com/layout-coding/
 No I didn't
 Me Banjo
 Ahh I see Brandon ;-)
 I'm secretly a professional coder :p
 BAHAHA
 *cough*
 Honestly :p
 hehe sure you are ;-)
 He still beats you BJ
 Lies
 Banjo > Brandon > Tim
 Pfft.
 Actualyl Tim you can't speak about coding you code in objective-c, right Alex? ;)
 you got your &gt; and at &lt; mixed up
 outlet: bring steve back then?
 I'm loath to decide which deserves my scorn more out of Obj-C/Cocoa and anything .NET :p
 Alex
 The only reason you dont like Obj-c is the syntax
 That's the only reasons I dislike Obj-c, yes
 Cocoa is another matter, closed platform
 reason*
 Alex: Why you not like .NET?
 Alex you just need to do a header dump and voila!
 The source is all yours haha
 Banjo: because it only really works on Windows
 and xbox
 the only thing i dont like about xbox is no web browser
 like on PS3
 i like c# its a bit like javascript in a way :D
 Tim, you could get the source sure
 But you can't actually use it except on Macs unless you go against the terms of the license on it
 Apple have no issues with you using the Private API's alex
 On Macs, they probably don't
 Well as Cocoa is a the OS programming API its seems odd that you would port it
 as its an interface for the AppKit framework
 Lies.
 Not all of it is platform dependent
 A fair bit of it extends obj-c in general terms
 And people have ported it to some extent already ;)
 Well there is a Java script port
 Objective-J
 It's just never going to have any real support on other platforms, which is why I won't be using it :p
 I think I mentioned it at some point
 Inasmuch as is feasible
 Qt is probably the best I've seen.
 I have yet to look at it

 Hmmm Pie``
 What kind of helm should I take tomorrow?
 A systemhelm, which can open like http://www.elsware.nl/media/MTR_black_open.jpg
 Or just integral http://www.fan.tv/motor/filecontent/images/IntegraalhelmNieuw.jpg
 i like the first one
 second one probably safer though
 They say systemhelms are safer though
 They usually have more protection inside
 Integral helms are usually more popular here in Holland :)
 around my neigbourhood I mostly see systemhelms :\  
 they anoyy me XD lol their EVERYWHERE GAH :\

 heheh I had like hallucinations last night lol
 oeh :O
 the valium was insane!
 I imagined being at the crash in the police car
 it all happening backwards
 I was txting keir one min
 then the next min my text was finished
 and all I could remeber was that little dream
 It happened a few times last night
 was odd
 I'll buy your job lot
 Branon you been speaking to andy :(
 .. Yes?
 http://i38.tinypic.com/2l8w3tu.jpg
 You whore.
 I am?
 whore whore whore
 You love it.
 duh
 banjo.... maybe they try to tell someone is a whore.. maybe...
 :O
 yes indeed
 anyone know how I can get internet explorer 6 on my computer
 windwos 7 comes with IE8 by default, and I need IE6 to test websites
 and browsershots is annoying.
 Andrew, I hope explorer destroyer gets passed :D
 means microsoft can't release anymore OS' with IE built in
 because apparently its a breach of user rights or somethihng
 psh, I have no issue with it but I think if they are going to release something built in they should REQUIRE it be upgraded after they are two releases behind
 I mean for god sakes people running IE6 should at the very least be upgraded to 7
 Tune right http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvWMLAWrEjU ?
 Alex, say you have 8cores yes. What would it be called? As you've got quadcore then ..
 Or someone ^ :p
 octcore I'd say
 octocore maybe even
 octo core yes. Apple does them :P
 If ya knew why'd you ask :P
 Well, I need to verify :p
 I'd call it a quaduo, sounds caller Xd
 Brandon, that song is pro
 I agree
 People who say MJ is a bad artist, are shitheads.
 hey Pie` if MS can't have IE included by default how am I supposed to download firefox when I install a fresh copy of windows?
 Have people thought about that?
 Andrew, part of the system
 no uninstalled
 because if you remove IE form windows it won't work
 because its an actual part
 Ahh
 okay, that still won't "really" change anything
 Just make it so you can un-install it :D
 It won't really change anything, and it will break a TON of applications
 I don't bother writing web pages for IE browsers, I just write "Best viewed in Firefox" in the footer
 Like for example, my html editor has a built in IE preview, and i'm positive that relies on the "built-in" ie
 Andrew, it won't break the applications they will just re-write the applications
 Andrew, it most likely uses the Mircosoft browser engine
 Pie`: You don't get that choice when your client uses internet explorer himself. And making websites for the masses you better have your site work in all browsers.
 In VB, you can create a browser in a few seconds, it's about 3 lines of code
 Lies.
 Depends what features you have in it
 Banjo, a window that will visit a webpage + display the page content, rather than the source
 and in vb it's internet explorers browser just inside your app.
 In visual studio 2008 theres a button that says "Create a browser" or something
 + I doubt it's IE inside your application, most likely the engine used for parsing html
 I'm nearly positive that instead of including the engine with your application it relies on the installed version since it is ALWAYS included with windows
 Pointless bulk in apps when windows comes with the engine
 Who would make a browser in vb anyway.
 Seriously....
 My friend did
 But I wouldn't use it XD
 Yes I made one in vb as well, but might as well use IE as its probably better.
 http://i41.tinypic.com/23hpruc.png
 Someone here has the authority as an administrator?
 or FF and Chrome as it is better.
 wow, my friend thinks he can turn that into a proper w3c compliant web page in 2 days
 Fixman: Me and Andrew do
 with no web programming experience
 Damn I could do that in an hour :P
 but Andrew, he has no programming experience at all
 of ANY kind
 in ANY language
 shit design anyway, he should throw it away
 :D
 Quote: "its not that hard to code a web design lol"
 Arg Andrew I don't think I can go back to vb lol, just opened it and started writing c# haha
 haha
 I'm not going to learn Qt for a while, I need to sit down and read a book on it. And finish my c++ tutorial I was going through before I even start reading about Qt
 Im going to get that C++ book Alex has
 Accelerated C++ I think it is.
 He, can someone tell me how i should stop the black background from going past the images? http://firechips.uuuq.com/test.html (CSS: http://firechips.uuuq.com/theme.css )
 hey*
 when making a web template Andrew, notepad or dreamweaver?
 notepad ftw
 neither I use RapidPHP
 I enjoy it's code highlighting and I love the built in PHP features it has
 Shit I use it to open txt documents even
 Andrew, jEdit.. :D
 I coded some vb in notepad :D
 Has an amazingly powerful search tool, lets you search with regex queries
 written fully in Java
 + has a package manager(<3)
 http://clients.crownstyles.com/ServerFactor/ I really don't know what else to do to this :P
 + code highlighing for shit loads of languages
 + a php tester, so it tests your scripts for errors as you write them
 and highlights starts/ends of braces
 () {} etc.
 AARGH :O BRB haffta get prices o_O WTH
 SEXY BRANDON! Maybe add a footer?
 mine does the same and it's NOT written in java
 Banjo yea. was thinking that :p
 I best add a member login aswell :p
 hehe
 Anyone here any good with Python ?
 Hey all,

 Thats just your coding Argo ;-)
 shh my coding is fine
 obviously not
 well then maybe you can fix it Pie?
 http://firechips.uuuq.com/test.html
 :S
 anyone?
 I'm afraid you have to do it yourself Argo
 Argo, I can't see whats wrong with it?
 we can help you with solving problems but we can't design it for you
 hmm..
 well... how doi fix the background from going past the images? works fine in IE
 I wonder if I could make an IRC client in PHP using pfsockopen()
 sorry, internet died
 php.net is down ?
 Whooo why so many divs :O
 i care if you say my web design is shit, ive only just started on web design, ive been using photoshop for the best part of 3 years
 Are you going to code it?
 Loads for me Pie`
 not for me :S
 It can't resolve host
 oh tehre we go
 www.php.net wrks
 prop not, coz i wona work on more designs befor i start coding it,
 do you know how to code?
 im learning.
 im new to this kind of stuff, and you lot are allready telling me to stop.
 No, we're telling you its poor
 not to stop
 I never said anything bad about it :P
 you, im just talking to a grate mate of mine, atlest he can tell me whats wronge with it, and how to inprove it,
 "you" ?
 Is that directed at all of us?
 and my new photoshop designs its good for 3rd ever design
 ye prop, i dono
 "5.3.0	 This function is now available on Windows platforms."
 the f...
 PHP 5.2.9 is latest
 Make the area at the top smaller, the slider thing is way to big.
 e lol
 the heck is that..
 theres a random "extra" text input box next to my normal typing area on mirc :S
 oh wait yes 5.3 is released
 so is php 6 :D
 but they're in development stages
 ye i know, but i dont like people sayin ishould binm it -.-
 Well wasn't me so :P
 No one said you should bin it either
 [19:01:31] <%Andrew> shit design anyway, he should throw it away
 acctually Banjo, not true
 Ok i lie
 ah he got to it before me
 Andrew said it
 sorry for being new at this 
 but he's right Hurricane, its not a GREAT design
 but yeh you don't do something based on ONE persons opinion, you don't like it just ignore it.
 just give us a charnce to get the hang of it 
 Try use a bigger variets of colours
 i know its not -.-
 But really you should concentrate on learning html/css before creating al the graphics
 otherwise you're going to have all these pretty images and not a clue how to use them
 i allready know graphics lol
 Thats not what I said.
 i know.
 So...
 [19:38:33] <Hurricane> i allready know graphics lol; pointless comment really.
 ... i will start leaning css and html again after i finished up modeling this car in 3ds max lol
 3d design FTW
 Desktop apps ftw ;-)

 I wanna see the new 2F2f :(
 2f2f?
 You mean f&f? :p
 YES :D
 in holland we call it 2f2f >_>
 but yeah, same thing
 Yeah, that was one of the questions on the questionaire Brandon, if we renamed it, what would we call it :-p
 Haha
 I'd suggest they delete the film and start over.
 With a much cooler name.
 And better actors
 Not convinced it'll be released.
 Like. . Tony Jaa, Steven Segal, Bruce Lee, Jet Li, Van Damme, Chuck Norris, Evlis, Myself, Jackie Chan so on..

 aloha Pie`
 Â¯\(Â°_o)/Â¯
 CONFUSED
 lol
 Tim, what are you confused about?
 My code is going in a book
 :S Like why mine xD
 Tis awesome
 but like
 WOW
 Why is your code going in this book? :o
 I was proof reading the new book on programing for the iPhone OS and rewrote some of the example code in the book for fun neated it up
 showed the author
 and its going in!
 replacing all the authors code
 haha
 how come, $newdata[$i][count($newdata[$i])] = NULL, but $newdata[$i][6] doesn't?
 The array has 6 values in it
 but not all
 which is why I used count($array)
 try doing count on it's own and echo is out
 like echo count($newdata[$i]);
 hmmm
 ah :D
 I was thinking about it the wrong way
 forgot arrays start at 0, so there was 7 values and the 6th was labelled as the last ong
 one *
 so I need to do count($array) - 1
 man I was going to say :(
 %Brandon rubs up against Amy Smart <Â£
 <3*
 Jealous much, Bread?
 :P
 No? Since I know the divide between reality and fiction ;-)
 aww :(

 Best tv show of the ninties was Space Precinct
 I'm actually waiting for "Hangover" the trailer is hilarious
 What the hell exactly is the css style property Azimuth doing?
 	-moz-border-radius: 4px;
 	-webkit-border-radius: 4px;
 ^ Are they w3c compliant tags?
 ... not related.
 :P
 Not sure, why not check?
 Does't seem so
 Property -webkit-border-radius doesn't exist : 4px
 Pie
 they are CSS 3
 thus not a standard
 I use them though
 Query statistics: Since its startup, 2,894 queries have been sent to the server.
 Thats on localhost xD
 Tim they are browser specific, and also don't validate if you select css3 as your validation type
 Yeah they have to be prefixed
 as css3 isnt a standard
 http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-css3-background-20050216/#the-border-radius
 this is the css3 way to do it
 with border-radius

 Latter is the last one or the one near the end, Alex can probably explain it better :-p

 ahh
 can you not just draw the cap under the H1 tag by putting the <div> before the <h1>

 Make WinUp in python ;-)
 wth is winup
 Greetings People of zymic
 Program Me/Andrew are making/made. Like GrabUp but for windows.
 Hey Peeki
 whats it do
 did jack read my request post ? or is he busy
 http://www.winupsite.co.uk/
 what post Peeki?
 last one on here http://www.zymic.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=2127&st=160
 Actually make a program so when you drag files to an icon in the system tray it will upload them to a users ftp account
 ben, the site doesnt load for me
 Banjo
 i downloaded it
 it goes
 Error 53 occured: File not found.
 Yeh thats a broken version
 :S
 Banjo, You could do this easily in php
 I don't know if he has Peeki, sounds good though.
 loll
 but not in Python
 because Python is CLI
 not gui
 but Banjo, I said a place to learn python ;)
 or something to make in php
 :(
 I don't know many languages, I know REALLY basic java, but quite a bit of PHP
 yeah it does sound good banjo, though i dunno how it works, hope its easy enough for jack, and doesnt cause any troubles or security issues
 btw Banjo, theres at least 1 spelling error on winupsite.co.uk ;)
 duce the memory leaks, well iv release
 "iv"
 Andrew did the site
 I'v ;-)
 but you posted it:p
 meh its gonna be redone anyway after my exams
 apparently
 Lies.
 Posted by Banjo on Wednesday March 11, 2009 9:19 pm
 *cough*
 I could make a page stealer :p
 like, to open a socket to a wesite and give the user all the source code written to an html file
 Yeh that would be usefull for me :D
 at school anyway
 Wget does it :p
 wget gets all images too
 and the css
 (If there is one)
 I've got Kate on windows :p
 and Knoquerer
 is python better then php
 lol
 You can't really compare them
 i know asp.net and php, i like asp.net abit better, but php is free >_>
 python can be used as a web language cant it ?
 I believe so.
 Peeki: asp is free as well
 asp.net isnt, lol
 well the asp.net servers cost alot compared to linuix which is free
 lol
 i think u need windows server or something, im not too into that side of things
 Yeh you need windows server to run the code but you can write asp for free, like any language.
 Morning all
 Peeki: ASP.NET is a free technology that allows anyone to create a modern web site.
 http://www.asp.net/
 Morning Robert
 morning
 asp.net is owned by microsoft, >_>.. theres always a catch
 I could write some asp code now and it wouldn't cost me anything :p
 thier IDE cost money, most asp.net scripts run on windows server 20XX which cost $$
 Screw ide's
 id rather use notepad
 Yes
 I really wanna install GNOME on this pc though
 Linux servers cost $$ as well.
 To get Gedit
 well, it cost me the rewritable cd
 lols
 which is 10p ?
 About that
 asp.net depending on how big your site is, i think they charge you more and more >_> lols
 brb gonna wash my hair
 The biggest cost has been time...
 asp.net webhosting usally cost alot more then php
 :p
 I can get a reel of 100 CD-R's for ~£7
 Such as now... Appears my parents internet has altered how it works
 so I don't actually know how to connect any more :p
 asp isn't worth the haslle, and which is why most fo teh sites which use asp are acctually microsoft owned sites anyway
 asp and asp.net are different though lol
 D:
 yeh, asp and asp.net
 6 Months Free on DotNetNuke Web Hosting!!
 All Versions of DotNetNuke Supported
 ASP.NET 3.5 & ASP.NET 2.0
 i didnt really like asp
 ^ Can't be all bad?
 asp.net is pretty good lol
 I'd still go with PSP
 PHP *
 as It's open source :p
 and open sourcing si the way forward!
 I agree for web based stuff
 not really for anything else
 brb cod4
 yeh php is awesome as well lol
 I'm trying to move away from PHP
 really robert ?
 how come ?
 Too web based
 oh i see
 Also, allows slack coding
 you have a point
 I want something stricter
 yeh !! i agree with that >_>
 I made a perfectly good IRC bot in PHP
 But, atm I don't have time to learn C++
 php suports slack coding like no tommrow >_>
 I have 3?
 I wanna learn C/C++/Python
 1 connected atm
 learn C#
 Robert, You could learn Perl
 its a lot like PHP, but not web based
 although it can be
 No, I'm going for C++
 if u learn asp.net, you could code with 2 languages, C# and Vb.net
 asp is platform based
 limits you
 h
 hi
 what do u mean by platform based?
 asp.net/c# pretty much requires windows servers
 meaning you have to pay for windows license
 yeh
 lol
 thats what i was saying before
 and meaning you lose LOTS of performance
 since windows servers are crap
 yeh lols
 hahah :P
 windows is like a truck
 liniux is like a motor bike
 lol
 only if it's a motorbike that can carry 20 tonnes of load
 anyways, is perl any good ?
 yeh lols
 nope
 perl is dead
 learn python
 whats the new go these days ?
 python ?
 yes
 lol my uni jumped on the python bandwagon really fast
 but they said it was just a stepping stone into programming
 not really too practical.. 
 well
 well i think thats what they said, since i didnt really do the unit
 depends on what you want to do
 you can build web apps with python better than with php (more OS hooks etc)
 true oop
 whats web apps ?
 i love oop 
 php pisses me off sometimes lol
 sites
 etc
 look at djangoproject.com
 for the most practical way to build sites in python
 u seen any good python sites ?
 does zymic suport python ?
 ovh.co.uk is written in perl
 Peeki
 gmail/youtube are built with python
 yes?
 really ? youtube as well ?
 yes
 browsershots.org is built with python and django framework
 why did google purchase youtube.com
 http://python.org/about/success/
 what was special about it ?
 success stories about using python
 Peeki, youtube uses more than 10% of the ENTIRE INTERNET's bandwidth
 yeh cause u watch one video, its like ur downloading 1000's of sites lol
 they must had some revolutionary coding
 or some optimization of videos or something
 that was new at the time
 python vs php, cons and pros ?
 bbl
 Good song.
 yeah that song rocks :D
 Who here has a CV ?
 Robert, you must have one as you went to that interview the other day :p
 CV for job?
 Yes
 No, not for that job
 But I do have one
 I got 6 T_T
 The interview I just went to didn't need one
 Why so many?
 And why Brandon?
 May I see it? :)
 Which one?
 Maths or Programming?

 Brandon, what happened to your ops?
 There
 there ya' go
 swordz???
 using te onfocus element
 to make an input box empty itself when click would it be
 onfocus="this.value=''"
 yeah I guess
 onfocus=this.value=""
 ^ thats it
 onfocus=' this.value="" '
 mine works jsut as good :D
 try this ^
 However, that's not a good usecase
 well I don't think it's valid html
 Are you trying to do something like having "search..." by default, and then get rid of it when the user clicks on it?
 its not for me anyway, someone just asked me how to do it
 Because if so, you'd be better off doing if(this.value == 'search...') this.value='';
 To avoid wiping actual user-input
 also there is an element for the first value like search... right ?
 hi guys
 hi help
 I don't know its not for me
  i want help when i try to add domain name it says error
 I was just asked how to clear a user input bo when its clicked on
 help, please join #hosting, I'll assist in there.
 ok 
 Well, pass on the answer in full with that caveat in case it's useful
 Problem solved
 Next please! ;)
 Hi Alex :p
 Oh dear
 Sure there wasn't anyone ahead of you in the queue, Brandon?
 Nope
 Lets pretend its just me, kai? :p
 Not sure, ok, well, in that case I guess we'll have to formalise the system a bit more
 I'll write up some numbered cards, and people can come and collect them here
 Sounds like a waste of time :p
 Why do you think I'm here? ;)
 Hard one to decide
 Guess so, maybe I should've started with the key stage 1 stuff
 Yeah. Maybe you should start now?
 hi all
 how do i hide?
 Find an hiding place? :P
 a*
 Favourites include: under the bed, in the cupboard, behind curtains
 man
 Or in the car
 mibbit is talking to me
 it says
 Brandon hides
 it also says brandon sighs now
 Yep, IRC does that
 Oh dear
 They're actions
 /me does something
 how to do that?
 I just showed you
 ^
 It's the /me at the beginning that does it
 /me test
 ???? D:
 No space
 there is no space
 i just did
 /me test
 :(
 Sure you didn't do //me test
 Pie`: What IRC client?
 lulz u guys got trolled
 ./msg #zymic /me test
 XD
 O_o
 Yeah, pretty much what I was insinuating
 The double slash does the same thing without needing to do /msg
 At least on this client
 And I think on most, x-chat does it as well that I know of
 naw it does skips the first /
 however, /////////ME Unknown command
 doesnt :D
 It might on other clients, I don't think it's standard
 //me had three slashes at the begginnnig for me though
 One of the reasons IRC isn't really amenable to pasting PHP, because you get one-line comments coming out as
 / comment
 someone come play uno with me, #uno
 :d
 Which of course then isn't valid.
 whats the opposite tag to onFocus /
 onblur
 thanks

 Hey Brandon, could you do me a favor?
 Which might be?
 NO :P
 The hosting you gave me, could you change it to a different ending
 like instead of /~waddlete
 Excuse me ? :/
 could you change it to something else
 Why?
 Sort out a domain? :p
 I need it changed to fit the website Im building
 hmm
 .co.cc...
 co.cc sucks
 better than nothing
 and better than a subdomain
 He has one but they take for ever to pro... something
 propagate
 yeah, it still isnt working
 and got it like 3 weeks ago
 What nameservers is it?
 mine are normally quite quick
 the ones you gave me
 What's the domain?
 what you mean?
 Nevermind brandon
 Watch he'll tell me it works now :p
 No, I'll just figure out something else, a uni.cc domain

 perry is this : http://villatregua.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/DSC00535.119214659_std.JPG :: in florida?
 Looks like all the new homes in florida.
 I hate living here, all the new homes look teh same. It's annoying.
 not sure, i found it on google images
 No, andrew
 It says its French
 http://www.firsthomebuilders.com/ go there, click "choose a model" and then look at your options. they all look the same.
 They are one of the big home building companies down here, and they are cheaper than custom homes, so ALOT of people use them
 It's annoying.
 Its actually a home made to rent out for vacations. Says it starts at $450$/night
 You live in florida?
 Yea fort myers
 Yes, he's a pedo don't talk to him ;'P
 Me or perry brandong?
 LMFAO BRANDONG!!!
 I made myself laugh.
 lol hahaha
 Thinking of my dong are we Andrew|Away? :o
 Mehbeh
 All t hose houses are the same :|
 Thought so
 I know perry, all the houses in cape coral (on the other side of the river) look like that, it's just annoying. 
 Why are they so low down :/
 O.o low down?
 My garage is so much bigger than them xD
 Yes, where is the upstairs? :/
 None.
 lmao you don't find many 2 story houses in florida
 There's maybe 1 every 10 blocks
 :P
 No basements either
 :/
 How much is a house like that down there?
 Now or at their prime?
 Now
 new I don't know, but you can find them now (from foreclosures) for around $100,000 or less
 prime they were going for high $200's
 Ohh, thats not bad.
 How much is flood insurance :P
 or hurricane insurance
 I don't know, we've never had any
 We've always rented
 Ah
 somebody stole pictures o_O
 omg..
 ?
 omg, this house in my area going for $3 million :OOOOOOOO

 God damn
 $4 a month heh
 Fucking Konqueror won't open
 Lot is 490050000 sq. ft.
 :O
 heck id buy that and never see it..
 that definately has to be a mistake
 I'm thinking that...
 but I'd probably sell it asap
 providing the price goes up :p
 I'm thinking the acres number, is supposed to be the sq ft
 But I also recon mistake
 Andrew that by you?
 brb
 Hey Banjo
 gah, cant find good pics of the house, ofc only thr crap one's
 Hey, not staying long just popped on for a break.
 ic
 Got LOTS of revision to do.
 I'm on Kubuntu :O
 I like kubuntu

 Permission to talk?
 NEVER :d
 Is that +v?
 http://www.cinema.philips.com/?ls=gb_en

 [15:29] *** Banjo gives Dolleh permission to talk.
 Thats a beautiful tv :O
 ic
 TheOracle, you using konversation ?
 :O
 yer
 She has it anyway
 :D
 Anyone know of a good AV for Kubuntu?
 Ok well just to let you know i probs won't be on till next week or so, so don't miss me to much ;-)
 aww thats long :(
 TheOracle, AV ?
 Wait, does Kubuntu 9.04 even exist?
 can I have your tea then?
 Antivirus
 psh, you dont need AV on linux
 rly?
 yes, rly
 orly?
 YES RLY
 btw, kubuntu 9.04 isnt out
 Hrm
 because i have the 2nd msot recent kubuntu release on lie cd
 and thats only 8.1
 ugh i hate from cms.. i had to edit the config file and to do that i needed to give it right access and i did that updated and uploaded then placed it back to 555 no write access and not it wont run cause it found the file to be writable...
 wait
 The taskbar thing says I can upgrade to 9.04
 i take that back
 "Latest update: 9.04 is Out in the Wild"
 http://www.kubuntu.org/news/9.04-release
 Hrm
 TheOracle, try in terminal: sudo apt-get install quassel
 its better than konversation imo :p
 ok :O
 Should I upgrade Kubuntu?
 did u use live cd
 or what
 I used Wubi
 that would have installed 9.04 im guessing
 and if you could upgrade to 9.04, t would tell you there are system updates available
 It says an upgrade to Kubuntu 9.04 is available
 And terminal couldn't find quassel
 type quassel into terminal
 see what u get
 no wait XD
 quassel is now default
 so you wont need ot instal it
 itll already be there
 I don't see it
 applications > internet > quassel
 [21:37:17] <+TheOracle> It says an upgrade to Kubuntu 9.04 is available
 oh duh
 Not there
 quassel is deafult for 9.04
 Ah
 Ok, lemme upgrade then
 jsut upgrade
 it doesnt take long
 and it installs the new KDe
 which looks nicer
 Jaunty Kackalope xd

 Ermm, google.co.uk seems to have loads of links that leads to many other links ;')
 how do you make it so your site can register domain names?
 because then I could get em free D: 
 You have to have a domain reseller
 but how do you start at the first step
 What is the first step you talking about?
 where you acctually register the domains yourself
 your not a reseller
 registrar
 ^ probably
 costs a huge amount to set up
 Oh that lol
 Tunage
 hmm
 Tis broken =[
 ewwwwwww R&B
 its just scared of you brandon
 xD
 Dlw ]
 I had every intention on doing that. *shifty eyes*
 i'm listening to 50 cent o_O omg unhealthy

 LOL.
 Better than taking a final for Failure Mechanics
 Engineering?
 Yup
 Swap you for Theoretical Physics?
 LOL...I hated physics
 I took physics I, II, III
 Yeah, but I imagine that's physics you can actually see
 I liked physics :(

 I'm using Quassel atm
 Gotta go
 Final is about to start
 C'ya
 TheOracle, imo its better than konversation
 Yea
 I noticed
 im installing xubuntu atm :D
 Why xubuntu?
 Old computer?
 bcause ive never used it
 and no
 other hard drive
 ic
 wubi cheats :P
 ittorrents the iso down
 then it hink mounts it
 but i havent got that far yet
 I'm afraid to reboot though, I got more than a couple errors upgrading
 weird O_o
 Although it never prompted me to upgrade
 what like
 er, restart*
 Like, operation is invalid, configuration for this package is already done, etc
 oh thats probably because you updated a program but the program doesnt know that yet
 like when i was on ubuntu once
 and i upgrade
 firefox screwed up
 ic ty
 until i restarted, it was because it had been updated along with the system upgrade
 ah
 ty
 its checking xubuntu installation files now D:
 Thats odd
 it just finished downloading them
 so yeah
 It says I have insufficient rights to rename a desktop shortcut
 restart your pc
 i bet you will fix it :p
 :(
 What if it goes ka-blooey
 IT'LL BE ALL YOUR FAULT
 wait
 download an ubuntu iso
 burn it to a cd-r
 then restart
 No. :(
 Why?
 if it doesn't work boot ubuntu up into live mode
 :D
 then isntall ubuntu
 If it doesn't work, I'll reboot into WinXP and forget about it
 Hopefully
 D:
 Well, brb
 is installed as dual boot
 or what
 Well
 It gives you the choice at boot time
 yeah itinstalled GRUB :P
 Wot be that
 the boot loader
 Oh

 Yes

 Netherlands ?
 ooh
 Im in the us..?
 :P
 We had another perry once
 he stole my name!?
 In advance, yes
 Are you sure it wasnt me? I havent been around for months
 i think it was me. i had been around for a while but stopped coming around until now
 how have u been alex?
 Lies.
 Perry, the old perry was a dirt bag etc.
 Apparently you've been away long enough to forget how pedantic I am ;)
 you*
 I'm fine, you?
 Not too bad. you still designing and whatnot?
 I've never been any good at design, I was doing the markup/backend stuff
 And not so much since I started uni
 Banjo
 Eng lit is awesome
 need any help
 ask
 hehe ok thanks :D
 Tim: I take it you do it then?
 if mice and men
 *of
 I do banjo
 :)
 I did that book in year 9 dronix :)
 Was rather good imo.
 Haha
 you can stop downloading thx
 k
 Mice of Men is win.
 Ending was good
 No its not
 not at all
 Rest was almost painfully slow
 yeah it was good, did that in high school too
 It's an awful book
 I liked watching the film most though
 i hate that book
 Same
 Try reading something likeâ¦
 the old man and the sea
 No
 What a rubbish book!
 why do u hate it? kill the rabbit
 Something more political
 that was just as bad
 Had that in my test today
 I think
 Nineteen Eighty-four is a must read
 Political eh, are we heading for Orwell
 Oh, we are
 crank :)
 :D
 Alex
 Well done
 Animal Farm
 Iv reaad a bit of that.
 another good Orwell
 :D
 Yeah, read both
 read*
 How about some Catch 22 too
 and maybe some Venguent (however its spelt) with Slaughter House Five
 That I haven't
 Oh an catcher in the rye
 a book for all young men
 Not necessarily a bad thing
 Banjo
 one thing to consider
 It's a shit ton of writing
 The guardian has ben goldacre's bad science column
 Yeh I know, Im taking 3 essay subjects :S
 I took three C/W heavy ones too
 and then crashed in exam weeks
 LIFE FAIL
 Haha
 Maths, Further Maths, Chemistry, Physics and Computing.  Not a bad set until you get to Computing ;)
 Alex
 I got a U for CPT6
 I might see if I can change my IT subject I chose (Don't ask why, I don't know :( ) to something else.
 He didnt understand it
 So he failed you?
 Maybe a real world commercial iPhone application was too over his head
 Yes
 What an utter tit
 Complain your ass off
 hes dept head
 no one to moan to
 The head? :P
 The governing body
 The exam board
 http://img207.imageshack.us/img207/6416/apdesign.jpg - last time ill ask for reviews on this. sorry haha just making final changes. thoughts everyone? thanks :)
 The local paper ;)
 haha
 Way too much spacing at the top there
 Between the navigation and the content, alex?
 Yes
 Looks empty, not minimalist/spacious :p
 Should i add something in, or move it down
 I'd try just moving it, but I have little creativity ;)
 Maybe ill move the logo and nav down, add a bar at the top for login?
 Tim, I think the local paper would quite like to run "student failed by teacher's incompetence" :p
 how about an image Perry
 Haha
 such as what, dronix?
 Alex I don't think they'd run it
 I told him I dont care that he gave it a U
 it made me 700Â£
 don't know, something that'll cover the width of that container
 hmm, hold on
 :O Lies, really?
 He's pretty clearly wrong to fail you, shame you're letting it pass :p
 Unless your report was shite ;)
 lol
 ahh was just about to say that lol
 Still, if you're gonna get a U in anything, that's probably the best one apart from General Studies :p
 Pretty useless subject as I found applying to universities
 grrrrr
 i dont know wtf to add to get rid of this emptyspace!
 did you try the image?
 i dont know what kind of image i would add
 im trying to come up with something to add the very top
 on top of the logo?
 yes.
 the very very top
 hmm, not sure it'll look right, logo looks good there

 There's no need to be using ie6 still, not when they are a full two versions ahead
 hehe, nah i don't use it. Used to on my desktop as its the only browser installed on it. I use chrome and ff
 ... theres no reason to be using IE period.

 And you cant use plugins that make remote connections

 WTF, rebel, http://www.rwarmedia.com/ has the logo changed?
 Oh I know why x'D
 Brandon, isn't it rawr? not rwar
 Just added 'We like it.' above rwarmedia
 Maybe
 http://rawrmedia.co.uk
 hey guys
 rwar looks like you have a typo in your text
 I can't be asked to changed it.
 It is
 Wasn't able to drop the domains so I'm going to keep them and keep the name
 Just as good I guess.
 Unique :'P
 the last one has rawr and not rwar
 Brandon: if you finish designing it before monday I can code it for you ;)
 I have a coder but thanks :)
 Andeh ?
 No
 Andy doesn't code for free ;-)
 haha
 is it gonna be that tall Brandon ? the page I mean
 Could someone write me a regular expression which would get the url from this <img> tag?
 <img id="item_image" src="http://itemdb-rs.runescape.com/2640_obj_big.gif?id=1631" alt="Uncut dragonstone"> 
 rebel, http://clients.crownstyles.com/MarketingMore/ it was orignaly that but the person didn't like it so I'm re-doing bits then going to attempt to sell it :'P
 Pie`: what do you mean ?
 I want the src element
 but ONLY the link
 you mean like a javascript command ?
 Brandon: why didn't he like it ?
 Ermm, it was for a compition
 Competition
 rebel, I need it to be regex
 isn't that considered cheating ?
 rebel: He preferd this; http://99designs.com/designs/1800516-original
 Brandon: where do you get your clients ?
 That's 99designs
 When I get clients from crownstyles they want coding which I can't do so i send them else where :'P
 So, I tell a lie and say I'm very busy and wont beable to do it. Rather than I can't code go to ... x'D
 haha, how many you get like this ?
 these *
 This month about 10/11 people
 how about I code them for you and get a share ?
 How well can you code? :'O
 I'm good
 Pie`: interesting, I would say
 Something like
 <img( [^=>]+="([^\\">]|\\\\)*")* src="([^\\">]|\\\\)*"( [^=>]+="([^\\">]|\\\\)*")*> would do
 ;o
 Sorry, got a bit of that wrong, well, it will work for most things already
 I probably won't need it anyway ;)
 but thanks
 That's sort of assuming you want to be sure it's just the <img> that it grabs, if you're already sure of that it's easier
 Just src="([^\\">]|\\\\|\\")*" (and that change to the parenthesised subpattern should be in all three of the original
 Have I missed half a conversation or something?
 Who, Bread?
 Oh, I just needed to scroll up :P
 wouldn't this be better suited to DOM?
 Meh
 Has anyone here ever set up dual monitors on ubuntu before?
 Yes, though with a nvidia card it's almost all GUI
 Set up 3 too, but you don't need to know that :-p
 What graphics card have you got Pie`?
 nvidia 8600gt
 I'm having problems with the nvidia x server
 It won't show that I've got 2 monitors
 So I can't set the second up :(
 Ah it's a doddle then, I found using EnvyNG had better results 
 sudo apt-get install envyng-gtk
 I'm not on it atm
 I guess I could restart though
 :D
 brb then
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8F495aMd50&NR=1
 thats crazy
 I laughed so hard when he puled the uzi + shotgun out
 I bet you can notice the shotgun when he's walking, but the others can be concealed pretty easily
 gah, back, run and hide!!! its back :O
 %Brandon has Nik Naks <'3
 jealous
 D:
 oo gimme
 I have a sausage sandwich
 ive not eaten yet
 n its 2:30
 I had one last night :D
 Bread, this favour is 'RibnSaucy' :)
 Ahah, I prefer the nicenspicy ones
 :P
 I'm with Bread on this one
 :D
 Me too.
 I don't like spicy food
 You know the awlkers competition
 their new flavours or w/e
 Only what shop had and BBQ mini cheeders :P
 Apparently Builders Breakfast won
 I wanted fish n chips :(
 Never tried any of the new flavours
 Aww
 Most of them tasted a bit weird
 like the crispy duck and hoisin
 Cajun squirrel was good though :D
 They still selling the others?
 Walkers made one whee it has a 'drive' flavour :/
 I think so
 Ahah
 I need to get some decent CD writing software
 Windows media play sucks so bad at  it
 Nero?
 nero
 I still think the best flavour walkers make is Worcester sauce
 player*
 I <3'd the worcester sauce flavour D:
 Agreed
 and Marmite
 Never was too keen on Marmite flavour
 Marmite D: =[
 I hate marmite
 but loved the crisps
 Marmine is eww.
 whats good for cd burning
 && free
 k3b
 there ain't no such thing as a free lunch
 Ah, I love marmite, but didn't like the crisps heh. Twiglets are the only marmite flavoured crisps I like
 ofc.. guys talking about food again.. lol
 marious, windows
 *cry* :(
 I agree with marious :P
 sorry... only use linux lol
 I normally do
 but i booted into windows to play cod4, but then found out it broke anyway
 ask osalt.com
 and then couldnt be bothered to restart
 http://www.osalt.com/nero
 all that trouble for not restarting
 screw it, I'll just get it off warez-bb
 CDRDAO and InfraRecoder eh?
 I haz nero
 +Dolleh <3 nero
 I used to
 but lost it
 ;]
 uh
 Nero is so damn heavy
 theres a portable version
 portable == light
 ah yes it should
 no idea haha
 you might be able to run k3b with kde on windows: http://windows.kde.org/
 got that Bread
 but
 Does it work well?
 It said I could find packages on the installer or something, but theres no dpkg :(
 It works perfectly Bread, no bugs so far
 Nice. How well does it interface with the underlying filesystem?
 Fine I guess, althought I have no idea what you just said :D
 Well does it allow you to save in all your windows directories etc
 yeah
 Nifty
 Might have to fire up my vm and give it a whirl at some point
 http://www.workatplay.com/
 ^ try the navigation buttons
 is that hosted here rebel?
 nope just found it at webdesignerwall.com
 ah ok
 Does not works without javascript
 only works if i enter the site without javascript from the beggining
 and the about page is bad
 yeah its using javascript for the page rollover
 uh
 http://www.contrast.ie/
 hahaha
 that page was funny
 lol @ âThe footerâ
 the whole site is on one page
 Now it is better
 without javascript works too
 What for?
 http://www.gpacheco.fr
 Pay for cPanel for server
 Heh, oh dear
 :P
 Loan it to you for a return of $60 ;)
 Heh, yea right.
 it's one of the biggest sins in islam to do that Alex
 this is why there is "Islamic" Banks
 It was considered the same in Christianity as well, they made the Jews do it for them.  Usary.
 I'm aware of that, but I'm agnostic, so I'm ok with it ;)
 so it's ok in Judaism ? because most of islam teachings come from Judaism 
 I don't think so, but they were told to
 money is money, religion is something extra to carry in your bag
 hmm :S
 And it ended up making them wealthy, and helped to foster the stereotype of money grabbing Jewish people.
 That they didn't want to originally is usually ignored ;p
 haha
 well that explains a lot of things
 many muslims say the Jews control west countries
 it's a kind of a conspiracy theory
 Yeah, those tend to develop
 Apparently Iran still blames almost anything that goes wrong on some unseen British hand :p
 bye
 Hizbulla blames israel for everything like that last German report about who killed Hariri
 also it's not always politics
 hi
 yellow
 hey
 http://madebyelephant.com/
 Guys, who knows a good designer?
 rebel is awesome
 webdesignerwall.com is awesome
 madebyelephant.com/ isn't loading for me
 Andy, Tim and Adam are all very good
 Adam, are you alive? ;-)
 Brandon's pretty good too.
 Maybe.
 O hai Adam =]
 yur not a zombie are you? :O
 do they have portfoliols?
 *portfolios
 plugin-visual: go for Brandon
 My portfolio is shite.
 plugin-visual: andy's portfolio: http://iam-andy.co.uk/
 oki :)
 His email is on there, says if you are interested then email him
 whats andy's nick?
 andy :-p
 He's not been on for a bit
 oh ic
 who made iam-andy.co.uk ?
 andy?
 andy
 andy i suppoes
 Yeah, he made his own portfolio :p
 heh
 lolk, well theres no link to the FAQ page on your second visit to the site
 That's the point ;)
 It says "looks like this is your first time here"
 but then theres no link
 after that
 it should link to "FAQ" in the footer or something
 I suppose, but if it was down there, no one would follow the link afterwards anyway I expect
 Craig's pretty good too: http://craigsworks.com 
 http://www.azcentral.com/offbeat/articles/2009/05/05/20090505beerpong.html
 wow...
 http://iam-andy.co.uk/faq.html
 what is cregs nick?
 ouch, spelling mistake...
 Greg?
 lol k
 Craig, but he only ever comes on IRC if I tell him :-p
 ic
 Yea
 for me :P
 When are you actually going to use that simplejax logo, Ed :p
 Haha
 Didn't realise andy designed pastesite
 His portfolio is linked in the footer, aye
 You obviously don't look at the footer :P
 No
 Never do
 Heh, when I finally get some time :-p
 There's never anything there
 I note that footer is out of date
 I usually php the dates down there
 :P
 Apparently I forgot this time around
 Alex being forget full ;o
 woah
 forgetful*
 Yea :P
 aha!
 I didn't think it was possible to cd to directorys that contained a space in their name using linux
 but if you escape the spce you can :p
 Or you can " " the path
 cd "~/path/to/dir with spaces"
 cd /home/noah/Desktop/c-drive/Program\ Files/
 :d
 Yes, I was giving an alternative :p
 escaping it seem seasier imo
 thats smilie looks weird pie`
 Guys, does anyone have craigs msn?
 Tab-completion will also automatically escape spaces for you
 but its all down to preference really
 "msn:  craig@craigsworks.com"?
 There, footer fixed, and now I don't have to look at it again :p
 ah, ok
 Does craig go on the zymic irc?
 Apparently only when Ed makes him
 http://pastesite.com/7278 What?
 Robert, I don't tihnk he can get ftp working :L
 Maybe
 I just thought seeing it was random
 I'm off
 bye people
 but i cant seem to get the program i am trying to work on it to transfer 
 night
 Bugger off you old git Robert
 ^ Makes no sense really D:
 bye
 arevoir rebort
 oops, meant robert
 ll..o
 dronix, isn't it, au revoir?
 lol* damned
 don't know pie`, just typed and it sounded good
 http://www.thefreedictionary.com/au+revoir
 ;]
 plugin-visual: I'll ring him now
 http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/technology/newsid_8068000/8068323.stm o.O
 he's coming
 plugin-visual: ^^
 Afternoon :)
 Hey craig
 Who invited you ;-)
 Hey Brandon :) How's it going?
 Good thanks. Yourself?
 Slightly tired but good! Bloody sod Ed woek me up :P
 haha XD
 s/woek/woke
 Aww :P
 Indeed!
 Well you managed to do an exam with no sleep, this shouldn't be any different ;-)
 Good point... although I think I failed so that's probably not a good sign how this will end :P
 He slept'd really just an excuse just incase he did bad :P
 Possibly...
 haha, smart one brandon lol
 No comment ;D
 :P
 Yea yea, what exam craig?
 Material Science *YAWN*
 Sounds it
 Yeah like I need to know the properties of amorphous window glass and its consituent former and modifer cations
 How very bloody useful! But no choice really :P
 Science is... crap =[
 I did some materials stuff as a part of physics, that was dull.
 Glad I don't have to do anything seriously
 On the plus side.... our lecturer looks like a Wizard
 Not sure why thats a plus... but it definitely was.
 And that's why I'm not doing any construction related engineering :)
 Anti-wizards Alex?
 What type of Engineering you doing Alex?
 RACIST!
 Software Engineering
 lol @ dolleh
 The kind of engineers who's managers think they can do your job as well as you can
 "I use Microsoft Word, how much harder can it be to make software"
 Haha... sounds about right
 Electrinoc engineer here. Cybernetics ftw!
 So we end up being quite good at improvising ;)
 s/Electinoc/Electronic
 Because we get requests similar to "you know that building you've almost finished?  We've decided we'd like a basement now" to a civil engineer
 Ah, fair enough, someone has to do it :P
 Except in comparison to a building, there's no need to uproot the house to add it ;)
 The hardware side of electronics just passes me by
 craig: well, like in a house you'd have to completely rework the foundations
 craig: that's the similarity I'm getting at :p
 *whoosh*
 craig
 Went straight over my head that one... I think I may need a bit more sleep haha
 Hi plugin-visual :)
 hi :)
 Because in a house you'd have to dig through the foundations to build the basement, and then you'd have to put in deeper foundations to support the extra weight
 Just PM'd you about somethin
 On the software side, alterations cause huge issues for the framework, general design of the system and integration issues.
           POW
 Haha :)
 alex you freelance? or do you work for a company?
 At the moment mostly neither :P
 Uni keeps me fairly busy
 ah ic
 How do I get to my PM list rofl... this is embarassing
 OH there it is
 should have a new window
 I had the channel list minimized... doh!
 Haha, someone's a bit sleepy ;-)
 your fault bread :D
 give some bread to the guy
 I'm looking to work summers, and I have a placement year after my next academic one
 I prefer the slapping
 heh
 So, the 2010-2011 year I'll be working somewhere
 Not sure where yet :p
 how many years do you have left until you finish uni?
 I finish mid 2013
 ah ic, I have to do another 4 years since I changed my major
 Mine is a five year course, four academic years and a year in industrial placement
 But leave with a MEng, so that's ok by me
 Same here :(. I had to do a foundation course as I had no Math A Level
 doh!
 Plus full exemption to apply directly for Chartered Software Engineer
 But still.... an extra year of being a fresher is fine by me ;) Freshers girls and freshers booze!
 Haha, fair enough
 I went straight in, I had done maths :p
 I got denied to do it because I only got a B :(
 Bad times...
 At GCSE?
 Yeah... but I couldn't only get a B beause I was placed in Middle group... go figure hm :P I got 100% too
 Heh, nice, sounds like the school sort of failed putting you there
 My college they let you go in with a C or above I think
 But it was a pretty big maths department
 1/3rd of the place was maths and the three sciences
 Yeah definitely school failure to say the least... but what can you do I guess? Another year at Uni is fine by me tbh... especially in this recession
 Did you pay fees for the foundation year?  Because that's a bit of a sting
 :( i lost my scholarship so I'm currently paying for my uni
 Heh, my scholarship was only £1k, so I couldn't have paid for it with that if I wanted to
 Not even a third of one years fees
 It was good to have, free money is always nice :P
 my scholarship was more than enough, had an additional 1k to spend every month, thats how I bought my laptop
 Yeah... an extra £3500 in debt because of it...
 *every semester not month
 I wish I had a scholorship :( Feeling the pinch not having a job atm... 
 But what can you do I guess =P
 That's what overdraft's for amirite?
 get a job?

 Haha that was a class act. Even Simon put him through
 craig, that wasn't an act
 well, his poetry was
 but that was REALLY him
 That's what I was reffering to ;) I had trouble believing it was his actual voice etc at first but obviously the tabloids had their way with him

 Grand Exchange parser?
 Theres another script busy parsing the Grand Exchange
 stickign output into sql db
 because parsing data from gedb itself takes a while
 a good 30secs per request
 Ahh I see, so you gonna have it update the db like every day or so?
 yeah
 I was thinking every 4 hours
 but the speed its going atm
 I may have to do every 24
 Nice, I made a desktop application that parses the Grand Exchange, it takes a while to retrieve the info because the site is rather slow.
 it was you! :P
 You posted that on Juw's site didn't you
 was made in .NET
 Yep
 My friend wanted to use your idea in a site
 which he mananged to drag me into, you remember fellixombc ?
 Have a newer version i made but haven't uploaded
 Yep I remember him, hot him on msn.
 got*
 I got dragged into that :p
 the site died in the end anyway, so it never went anywhere
 ahh lol i see
 this ge parser has done a good 4.5k pages so far
 I know how i can improve it
 but its gotta run > once for me to do it
 cool story bro
 thnx
 Sweet

 yes
 http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/The_game
 shit, not the answer i wanted
 do you guys allow ads? like google adsense?
 Yes
 providing its not for a spammy MFA site
 Jack, of course not
 Jack, is there any reason why the ads would not show up after just cut and pasting the scipt that google gives you into the body of a webpage?
 It usually takes 20 minutes
 opera keeps segfaulting today :/
 Jack, would'nt there be like a blank box or something? or does it take time for that to show up too?
 takes time
 blank

 128 core ?
 thats what it says
 In November 2008, a patent-pending method appeared which purports to combine rainbow tables with a system to keep track of the key space covered by the rainbow table and this methodology has been called a Thunder Table(tm) by its inventors. In combination with a 128 core GPU, rainbow table look-up and construction is now 25 times faster than using a conventional CPU.[6]

 You could I would say with minimal effort and maybe $xx,xxx build something with a thousand cores using GPUs
 come on guys it's just the underline
 Alex look in #hosting please.
 i wanna get rid of the underline from underbeatg home, about, contact and archives

 gimliglider: well, pastesite does, so you can find them there
 oh yeah...!
 and also, assholes like to ruin the forums and use a proxy :(
 thanks wait i didn't think of that!
 there is somehting like navigator at line 360, not div.navigator
 also do you want me to add the {} brackets or no?
 gimliglider: in this case, they're equivalent because .navigator is only used on a <div> tag
 oh ok
 Alex, mind telling a person that manages the hosting site to cancel my account?
 Say that you want it done in #hosting, and provide your username
 Then one of them can get back to you to verify you're the owner
 Or you could just delete everything off the hosting, it's basically the same thing
 gimliglider: you don't want more than one set of braces for each section
 So I meant add in "text-decoration: none;" to those sections
 Or actually, there's already a text-decoration in that second section
 So you'd just replace that with "none" instead of "underline"
 wow thanks that worked like a charm. Instant and precise headshot!
 PcGamer, if you're looking to block HTTP Proxies on your forums, this will help a little: http://pastesite.com/7489
 it just blocks all connections from which port 80 is forwarded, and 9 times out of 10 its not just a normal user.
 well Pie` all my stuff's gone now so it doesnt help
 don't leave me :(
 I have to :(
 http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/eula_dev.html?dl=mac
 Chrome for Mac
 brandon will keep you company!!
 and adam
 Linux version is available too
 Both unstable
 And for Linux, I know
 Early developer releases though
 Not intended for public use at all
 Ah well
 I'm not the public
 bye restarting wierd comp behaviour
 I can't wait for true release of chrome for linux
 going to be so epi
 brb
 although I doubt it will be as fast as firefox w/ tmpfs
 I'll be waiting in bed, Brandon and Adam.
 oeh...
 I quite like Chrome :)
 Adam, I keep changign back to firefox because I've got some epic addons installed, but chrome keeps dragging me back kicking a screaming
 Plugins are gay
 Is that what you tell yourself in vain trying to pretend Safari's any good ;)
 I like speed
 I couldn't care less about plugins
 Though, Safari 4 isn't terrible, before that though it was kinda embarassing how much it lacked compared to other browsers
 What plugins do you have that are couldn't live without?
 you*
 Hmmm, what do I have that I use fairly often
 ColorZilla for some things, that I could live without, but would rather have a built in eye-dropper than go to a screenshot in gimp or something
 you ever tried watching an animated gif in chrome?
 much better
 I can actually use numbers now!
 brb
 Have u guys heard about Google Wave?
 Thats going to rock when its properly released.
 ColorZilla doesn't work on linux :(
 wave is good
 what's wave ?
 extension ?
 look it up on youtube
 youtube ?
 but basically, its this email/im sort of thing thats run completly in browser, no applets no addons
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_UyVmITiYQ
 http://wave.google.com/
 video is a bit long, but watch first like 15 mins, you'll get the jist of it
 it looks really good
 https://services.google.com/fb/forms/wavesignupfordev/
 Are you pain tolerant enough to work with APIs that are still in flux? * - Yeah! I walk on fire and swim with sharks. - Maybe, I mean I jaywalk sometimes... - Not really, arm floaties and seatbelts please!

 What? :/
 You mean mock up ?
 yeah sorry
 mock up
 Okay, no it' not.
 brandon
 I has a php script that takes a font and makes whatever text you want into an image, simple stuff really but it's already done. You can use it to dynamically create those titles on bigroper
 <img src="text.php?She's Getting it hard">
 etc
 Just have to figure out how to create the white outline like you have already
 and how to tilt it a bit
 I see
 You mean the drop shadow ?
 That can be done with CSS3 :P
 hmm
 Brandon: where did you get the images ? :P
 I'll bbs

 and if you set s, you can choose sha1/md5
 woot! have fun!
 otherwise it picks for you, i tihnk
 they don't have a rainbow table

 and yourself?
 Did you win?
 lol
 Sounds fun, should of done paintballin' tbh. I did nothing as per usual, raining here =[
 I'm going to blame Frank.
 Rain? I got sun burnt today!
 What?
 Jack been sunny all week but today =[
 I got sun burnt on me nose lol
 I got sun burnt on my shoulder/back
 Won one of the games Jack, the last game we were so bored we started bowling the slowest :P
 :)
 And it peeled
 Okay Frank..
 lol
 Yea, 3 hours of bowling would get boring :p
 lol
 Should of just got out the wii :p
 I have a wii
 So
 Has anyone ever tried this - http://www.pixlr.com/editor/
 Nope
 Lets design a website in that :-P
 Hey anyone know any php hosting websites that do allow proxy hosting
 Nope spirrwell, did you setup a website on Zymic to find you couldn't?
 spirrwell, im sure http://localhost/ would allow you too
 I don't see why it wouldn't.
 It's in the rules, you can't host proxies in zymic.
 Okay I'll try Pie
 it says the link is broken
 Rofl...
 Ah, just checking because we could clean it up, nice to know someone reads them :)
 What do you mean clean it up?
 What did you mean by clean it up?
 LOL
 Nice one, Pie`. ;)
 spirrwell: I'm guessing remove it :p
 Remove what?
 I guess I'm the mockery here :/
 spirrwell, I guess you could say that ;)
 I lol'd.
 http://www.zymic.com/forum/index.php?s=&showtopic=18215&view=findpost&p=97709 lol :p
 haha XD
 Interesting person you're trying to help on the forums, Brandon
 Why Alex?
 I have a suspicion it's not going to be that easy to get any coherent answer :p
 Perhaps :p
 I reckon he thinks he's already adequately explained the problem
 More than likely some people are like that, sadly ohwell I like a challenge.
 Oh ok be like that :(
 He may think his post got deleted or something haha
 Moved it?
 Yea
 You can leave a ghost topic behind if you're worried about that, then remove it later
 But that requires that you're organised ;)
 :P
 I'm not organised unforchuntly. You should look at my FTP's very messy :p
 I ought to sort that out well not anytime soon heh
 oh my...
 NSFW: Lady Gaga has a penis
 No she doesn't :/
 she does
 That's so fake.
 she is a hermaphrodite
 she admitted it..
 If shes has a penis them I'll be sick O_o
 its only a small one
 but she has one
 then*
 Proof? :p
 google it
 "lady gaga hermaphrodite"
 Ah, random sites on the Internet, all the proof you ever need
 Hah, freek of nature but I'm not convinced it's true :p
 freak*
 http://starrtrash.blogspot.com/2008/12/lady-ga-ga-admits-true-sex.html
 Just read that. Look how unprofessional the typing looks.
 "Good on you Gaga! We won't judge you at all."
 apart from al those men who fapped non-stop over her
 thinking she was a full on sexual female ;)
 Why would someone fap over her? :p
 a lot of people think shes super hot
 If you call this hot then you've got shit in your eyes; http://www.gossipcheck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/lady_gaga_01.jpg
 and how old is that?
 ;]
 people say shes like wine, gets better through age
 :p
 yep, shit in the eyes. looks like a mushroom
 :P
 http://www.zymic.com/forum/index.php?s=&showtopic=16614&view=findpost&p=97724 look at his sig no referral link but such a random link :-P
 SEO abuse most likely
 I see

 You see the mass amount of replys ?;
 :P*
 Saw this from a mile off, they post in as many threads as they can, then they just stick their link in their sigs afterwards
 http://grabup.crownstyles.com/24b91e51044ba836e84b327cb2d0941d.png < Makes you think hes a spammer of some kind :p

 Don't you just love that feature, Bread? :p
 I do Alex, I do :-P
 Hey, whenever I open a png image in Internet Explorer, it opens it up in quicktime?
 Because you're using windows.
 :p
 So
 I'll just remove quicktime
 Okay.
 that would be a mistake
 why?
 it's associated png with quicktime
 if you remove quicktime, it won't know what to open it with
 it's far better to re-associate
 xp?
 Vista
 Heh, I created more spam by putting them in trash can :-p

 I hate restarting my pc

 Nothing worked though
 Unplugged VGA and replugged, turned off and on, nothing
 Just kept going back to a black screen
 New bg yay
 wonder if WinUp will be able to capture this
 http://i38.tinypic.com/2w4xmvs.jpg
 Thats on the CRT
 Nice!
 Ok, fullscreen...
 Where did you get that background?
 well, here's my LCD
 http://i38.tinypic.com/2uejomd.jpg
 WinUp can only grab one screen at a time I guess
 Frank: I forget
 lol
 Its my desktop bg though
 outlet, do you have an ignore list for join messages?
 http://i34.tinypic.com/2i1z788.jpg
 TheOracle: I have that. :)
 Figures, you have a mac amirite?
 NO :o
 :o
 I want a Mac Mini or something
 I have a MacBook ;-) ï£¿
 but they don't have VGA ports
 so fail
 You can get a converter :p
 true
 more money wasted though
 don't see why they can stick one in there
 can't*
 Bass_Guitar, do you have an ignore list for join messages?
 Bass_Guitar means he's away asswipe
 TheOracle: No need for that :/
 with winup
 do i jsut hit printscreena
 and ti gets uploaded?
 No
 You do ctrl + alt + 2
 thats fullscreen
 How many times do you use a laptop with an external monitor? :/
 1 is selection i.e. pick somewhere
 3 an active window
 When I'm at home Bread
 Laptop + monitor
 FTW
 TheOracle but now he'll get the nick alert
 And will answer me eventually
 Well thats just too bad innit
 winup fails
 How
 it only screenied my primary monitor
 not both
 Thats what I said
 <TheOracle>WinUp can only grab one screen at a time I guess
 it can onyl di primary
 not one at a time
 Yes
 Great, I forgot what I was going to do
 Was fucking important too
 I just use a simple irc :P - http://i37.tinypic.com/do2p8h.jpg
 That Win7?
 No
 I prefer xchat with the tree view
 Vista

 XChat isn't simple
 lets see yours
 Its far more complex than Nettalk
 Bread?
 Just hiding some channels Frank 
 oh
 :o
 :D
 :o
 why?
 Cause they're secret.
 oh
 :P
 :O
 I should get pyD
 Everyone is bringing their bots here XD

 How many channels do you have to hide, Bread?
 I screwed up so starting again :P
 :/
 Frank: http://bread.uuuq.com/xchat.png

 yes
 but I much prefer mIRC ;)
 Yep, for Linux and Mac, and there's a free version from http://www.silverex.org, what version have you got Frank?
 Do you use mIRC Pie?
 Frank: Yes

 Bread, on linux I just did, sudo apt-get instal xchat :D

 Join #hosting
 Just leave it
 If no one replies talk to me and I'll do it
 Robert is helping him/her
 thanks guys
 Bread, my thoughts exactly
 I cant wait until the new version of zymic comes out, I think someone was saying that it has an account deleter
 just a little bit wierd
 I have like 14 host accounts
 Frank, I have 21 :-p
 lol
 I had 40? at some point
 lol
 Brandon: Might get one of these http://tinyurl.com/lbphdl or http://tinyurl.com/47ynys
 Ah, just 18 now
 haha, test accounts are evil.
 Omg
 When I go over the tiny url links they show me the normal links :D

 http://grabup.crownstyles.com/39c4c13f601c32ab7c49eceb72ceb65c.png
 ah, now that's a nice feature
 Hey, could I get www enabled?
 Yeah, which domain Frank?
 um, grab.uuuq.com
 Bread want to buy me it?
 FUCK SAKE
 I can't printscreen it working =[
 Rico: If you don't stop that I'm going to hurt you.
 !seen perry
 I don't know who perry is.
 Frank why?
 huh?
 it has nothing on it
 I'm still building it
 ben come on alienware dude
 lol
 what did i do brandon
 ??
 What's it going to be?
 I'm not sure yet :p
 really?
 I have an idea
 yeah
 what?
 I don't like it though
 lol
 well what is it?
 you are building something and dont know what its going to be
 lol
 the name suggests a file/photo uploading site
 yup
 And they're not allowed
 that is what I was gonna do first, but it wasnt allowed
 Rico: What you mean?
 Rico:	ben come on alienware dude
 why isn't it allowed ?
 alienware is a whole lotta crap
 file hosting isn't allowed
 Lol whats better?
 Specs look sick
 So now I dont know what I'm gonna do
 listen you can build a pc twice as fast for the same price ben
 Was debating that or a mac, then i saw the light and decided on alianware
 Yeh but i want that keyboard :(
 if you strap for cash go to V
 if you strap for cash go to http://www.falcon-nw.com/
 Oooh
 Rico, I live near them :D
 well sorta
 those guys are the sick ones
 about 100 miles from them
 hmmm Alianware FTW!! ;-)
 Robert, what should I do?
 Not a file upload site
 but it does not matter cause with all computer manufacturfers you just payin for bran
 maybe I'll just use it for my winup
 Bread, I dont need the www
 frank clearly it seems as tho you dont really have a reason to build a site
 are you board?
 yes 
 lol
 uhhhhhh i give up
 o u
 on u*
 Using it for winup is still file hosting Frank
 grrrr
 lol
 wat about the hosting you got from me?
 I just want something simple, grab.uuuq.com
 but now i cant :(
 well at least with me you can file host all you want and bread cant say nothing about it !!!
 lol
 Rico: Yes it does matter ;-)
 wats the difference ben
 Rico - there's no prices on their website
 that always worries me
 The Brand :D
 falcon ?
 They are really expensive
 Alianware
 you gotta configure the system to get a quote
 <Rico>if you strap for cash go to http://www.falcon-nw.com/
 falcon are miles ahead of alienware
 <Frank>They are really expensive
 yup
 And I know they are, cause I live about less than 100 miles from them, and I visted it
 those 2 comments don't follow each other
 well ben if you got cash buy falcon 
 Im broke lol
 then build a desktop 
 or buy dell xps
 Bread, you can just delete grab.uuuq.com since I cant do anything with it
 Nah I don't like desktops
 lol
 dell xps if for you then
 Or Alianware ;-) See I decided Im not going to pay Â£150 to fix my ps3 so just buy a Â£2,323 laptop instead :D

 Nice little feature there though Brandon

 No, that's Linkinus 2.0 well, the beta build.
 ic
 Private beta* :p
 Apprently we'll get a free copy rather than paying for it when they've fixed up all the bugs :-P
 We as in Mac peeps?
 whoa
 http://www.winupsite.co.uk/support/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=5 Not really NSFW, mebbe
 There is a forum :O

 winup has a forum :O
 Dur
 Is the Tetris logo of google meant to be readable?
 I thought you knew
 Nope Bread
 Just ghey
 even though I <3 tetris a bit
 :O
 Bread what?
 http://www.google.com Robert 
 Oh, are you meant to be able to see the word google in it?
 probably
 I've looked it from multiple perspectives and strain to see it
 Good to see my plugin's definately working correctly!
 Bread, the google tetris image sort of is
 Blue G
 red o
 yellow o
 blue g again
 yellow o with no hole
 green l
 red e with no hole
 red e
 its not PERFECT but
 its nto far off
 Now I've gone and got myself banned from crownstyles.com =[
 o.O doesnt sound good brandon
 Smooth
 get a proxy?
 lol
 Robert: I can't remember my password :-P
 ah
 so that's not the only problem then
 Nope
 Means now grabup wont work aswell :(
 I would like to echo Bread's sentiment ;)
 Not that he hasn't gotten himself blocked by certain server firewalls before :p
 Heh, just as bad as me Ed :-P
 Not quite, it wasn't because he forgot the password
 :(
 lol
 I need Sazzad.
 ;-)
 I attempted to go through a IP:PORT Proxie but never worked for me. =[
 i'm managing 16 e-mails and about 25 accounts, all different passwords and stuff, remember them all! and even some friends acount info :P 
 I changed my password like 3 days ago as I gave access to it for someone but then forgot it. :-P
 XD
 Brandon can I help?
 Ermm?
 Bread, he doesn't have root to su to
 Brandon, I'm guessing you can't change the password via shell ?
 You need to know the password to get on shell O_O
 XD
 thats what I thought
 Oh sorry, just read up, you've forgotten your password :-p
 ouch!
 That is abnormally large for a toaster.
 amai...
 You know those big ones you get in schools for mass amount of cooking? One of them :P
 An industrial toaster
 Just throw a sliced loaf in, and get toast out
 epic ^
 I could do with one fo them D: 
 :-P
 Yeah...
 I want toast now :(
 I wonder if they actually exist
 Alex: probablu
 Well, sure big toasters do, not sure whether having it sort out loaves into slices would be cost effective :p
 Alex: at ym dads workplace they have this machine thats got boread on like a constant loop
 bread *
 so theres alwasy fresh toast
 sort of like: http://www.bellecocooking.com/images/jt1.jpg
 Pie`: You okay?
 Brandon, jsut woke up
 my typing is poor 
 I noticed :p
 Which is not quite a cool as being able to just chuck a loaf in ;)
 and yeah, it is just past 3pm :p
 But just waking up aint a good enough excuse tbh :p
 it is when you've slept for 15 hours nearly
 ;)
 How can someone possibly do that.. :/
 Okay, Brandon, what you do is you lie down in a bed, close your eyes
 and dont open them again until you need to
 ^_^
 o.O
 And wake up in about 8 or 9 hours without any choice in the matter
 That's me anyway
 Well, arnt you clever :p
 Same Alex
 Well not so much 8/9 hours. I went bed like 4:30 or something and woke up just after 9 :p
 Well, that's because you went to bed at stupid o'clock
 XD
 I mean, if you weren't out last night why :p
 I'm not tired nor am I like ermm what's the word, lack of energy?
 If I'm coming back in around 3am or something maybe I'll go to bed around then
 Otherwise, I like my sleep :p
 Haha
 If I had it my way I wouldn't sleep
 I mean, if it was possible :p
 Now I need Tim :(
 aww :(
 using an xml package in php, how would I get the values from the following xml tag:  <object name="Crate" type="0" description="I wonder what's inside.">
 so like, how would I get the value of name ?
 What's the structure of the whole XML doc?
 <object name="Crate" type="1" description="I wonder what's inside.">
   <action>Search</action> 
   </object>
 but different object name's, types descritps etc
 You can grab tags by their name, so get all <object> nodes
 and different actions
 http://uk2.php.net/manual/en/domdocument.getelementsbytagname.php for example
 Would give you a DOMNodeList of every <object> tag
 getElementsByTagName("name"); would give me the value of the name tag inside <object> ?
 No
 It would give you a DOMNodeList of all the object tags
 Which you can then loop over to get to the DOMNode
 Hey you guys D:
 hey Brandon
 Something bad about OSX why have a screensaver if you can't see it? :/
 When screensaver starts the screen goes dark :p
 Oh, forget I even said that. :O!
 Why is there pop-up ads on here? - http://www.uuuq.com/404/index.html
 I didn't get any pop-up ads?
 Look at the source then, at the bottom
 I did
 I did too
 Oh I see.
 I have popups disabled :-P
 Oh, well its annoying
 So?
 Not like it matters, if you fully functional site then you wont get that, will you? :p
 I guess I'll just use .htaccess to fix it
 Wiihii
 Pie`, I build in my Angel Eyes on my scooter :)

 Okay now this is weird!
 What is weird?
 I'm using the old Linkinus and now when you posted a picture it's showing it when it never use to
 Normally would just show a link :-P
 Juw, that looks really homo ;)
 Pie`, well, it isn't pink right?
 :)
 Pink aint homo colour..
 Oh wait, what was the new colour
 purple or something?
 Yellow is more a girls colour :-P
 I'd say black is the emo colour, red is the crap colour and blue wins
 Yay, new Coda :D
 Juw: Black aint an emo colour for cars and bikes or anything just EMOs decide to wear lots of black and black makeup the big gayers. :p
 Wow that was easy... I basically bought this option on my phone for all day internet yesterday for Â£1, but when I pressed the back button in the browser of my phone it refreshed it and charged me twice, so I rung up orange, told them my issue, they're refunding me the extra pound and then I pushed for a refund of the charge of the call and I got that too :)
 Nice Bread! 
 Haha!
 Bread, black cars suck.
 Brandon*
 Brandon? :p .. Also, no they don't White & Black cares are win.
 cars*
 Well, they're not that bad.
 White cars with black tinted glasses are epic
 windows etc.
 Tinted glasses? You means windows yea? :
 :P*
 white ccars are bad because you can see the dirt on them
 so always look messy
 after youve driven them, no amtter how far
 It rains here all the time, so the dirt will get off easily over here :)
 Depends where you live and how dirty the streets are. UK seems pretty clean to me :p
 I agree, I was born there
 Lies..?
 I come there yearly, so ye.
 I'm not lying
 Brandon, depends where in the UK you are
 road qualities, etc.
 black cars have more accidents
 Like I said; Depends where you live and how dirty the streets are.
 statistical fact
 :S
 hardly authorative, but still http://www.viamichelin.co.uk/viamichelin/gbr/tpl/mag5/art20070801/htm/mobil-auto-accidents.htm
 You can't see black cars in the night
 Juw, thats what lights are for ;)
 so you can see them
 http://www.wisegeek.com/is-there-a-link-between-car-color-and-accidents.htm
 Black cars <3
 Pie`, black cars crash too often, the lights are usually broken
 Hummers in black are fine though
 of and Audi

 anybody knows if there are known problems with google indexing of uuuq? I was just told the reason my sites are indexed only to about 5% of total size could be a "bad neighborhood" situation. Is uuuq on any known "bad" lists anywhere as far as google is concerned?
 Updating the 13" MacBook today as well. Gets the new display, SD card slot and better battery life. Crap, they updated my laptop :(
 Who knows Java here?
 It wouldn't surprise me mater, we have a daily struggle keeping off all the SEO spam.
 my index dropped from about 20k indexed pages (out of average 50k) down to 600 during the last month. Then, during last few days it started to go up, and then stopped and seems to be going down again. Also, google bot basically stopped indexing the my uuuq sites as graph shows a drop of google bot activity down to basically 0 during the last week or so (there is a 1 week delay in what google shows about its bot)
 Adam :O
 Fuck sake, updated my macbook with firewire, sd and other stuff and added to macbook pro line..
 Bread, want to buy it?
 That takes the piss =[
 :p
 Going to give me the money for it Adam? ;-)
 Bread you can have mine I'm going to get the updated one.
 x'D
 But being fair they fixed everything I hated about my macbook, the dicks.
 Deal Brandon DEAL 
 lol
 Bread, so you think there IS a possibility like that? Actually, I could see that cause lots of kids to all sorts of stoopid stuff with "throw away domains" I guess. But are you aware of any facts on this matter and do you know where I can get more info on it?
 DO all sorts of ... you know what
 I'm really not sure mater
 ok, thanx anyway
 Bread, btw, how do you "keep off all the SEO spam" if it is not a big secret?
 Hey, there is a question in hosting "hey frank, can i make a social networking site like facebook using the free hosting?" so what do I say, I really want to answer this
 nevermind
 We watch the uploads mater
 and a few other tricks
 Bread, and what do those uploads tell you? I am not sure what kind of uploads you are talking about. Btw, I just did a huge upload of about 30k pages with latest version of mfcgoldmine
 you mean spam is somehow associated with uploading stuff?
 no, it's content
 Yup, they upload lots of pages with deep links, when you visit the page, it's pretty evident it's seo / mfa spam
 oh, I see, you mean upload TO zymic?
 that is prolly not that difficult to manage to see what kinda crap ppl upload to their site
 http://cache.gizmodo.com/assets/wwdc2009/wwdc2009-210.jpg
 Get safari ^
 Robert, you could prolly write a lil shell script that rings da bell when someone uploaded some stuff to his site and you can just go and take a peek :--}
 well, anyway, thanx for your time
 We do have a level of automation, but largely a lot is checked by hand, I can't really go into it.
 excuse me please can any one help me
 Sony are gay!

 Does anyone know how to speed up Internet Explorer?
 I don't need to buy my software, I use linux ;-)
 I had to move to FF cause it was slow
 I have bought xchat in the past though (for windows)
 Why would you 'choose' to use Internet Explorer? :/
 Heap of junk.
 +1
 I dont know, I've used it for years
 [19:25:37] <Frank> Does anyone know how to speed up Internet Explorer?
 unisntall windows + install linux
 then set up firefox to use a tmp fs
 Never tried Chrome
 I had them all installed before I reformatted
 I can't install Chrome *shakes fist*
 Though I'm VERY happy with Opera
 Who thinks I should try Chrome?
 Sure you can, Bread :p
 hehe :(
 Wine doesn't count Alex :-p
 Native install please
 Fair enough
 Sure you can, Bread :p
 Chromium Alex?
 no theres a developer version bread
 Oh dear, you're trying to make me repeat myself again ;)
 ^
 Oh, since when?
 Couple of days ago
 its been in development for ages
 Ooh, this I was unaware of.
 Since about the 5th
 svn?
 There're binary packages for Ubuntu and Debian I beleive
 Any links please? ;)
 chrome.google.com
 ?
 google.com/chrome?
 The linux version points to just a place to type an email address 
 http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel
 Thanks Alex, I was under the impression Chromium was the source, which just so happens to conveniently build on linux, but not completely functional.
 Still through chromium.org, but it's technically a pre-alpha developers only version of Chrome
 I just got through to a fit blonde woman on sony help line :D

 Deformed belly button imo.
 Heh, no they didn't Pie`

 Google Chrome doesn't seem to run badly at all, loads of broken bits, but the core seems to work nice. Unfortunately, the KDE window styling's are still around the window though.
 Alex, how long did it take you to create PasteSite?
 *nicely
 About a day
 Really?
 Cool
 Did you do all the php yourself?
 It uses pear's Text_Highlighter
 I did it ;-)
 Otherwise, yes
 alex did you get my email about pastesite?
 Haha : http://www.zymic.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=18270&hl=#

 Bread - deleted it, sorry
 about using themes for the color hightlight, such as twilight from textmate
 Alex "in a c**t your dull host will go Russians of find!!!"
 Oh, right, yeah, I forgot to reply to that honestly :p
 lol Bread
 I think alex's comment was @dronix Bread
 3 nick alerts in one, oh yeah!
 :P
 its cool
 There is a bit of that already, in that if you're on a paste
 You can switch it to a dark theme
 I'd like to see desert from vim
 The dark theme is stolen from vim basically :p
 I forget which one
 I think I sent you link to working example
 Yes, I was aware of that site anyways
 will uncooked potatoe kill u?
 no
 Why would you eat uncookied potatoes in the first place?
 cooked*
 Or cookied, sounds like a decent culinary technique to me
 cookied potatoes...
 sounds nice
 I'm not sure if it is cooked or not
 Well, eat a bit
 if it's REALLY hard
 it's uncooked
 Was cooking hash browns, put them in for another 5 mins just in case.
 Cookied potatoes, one to go along with the spaghetti bolognese burgers
 hehe

 Iphone new please? ;)
 *news
 new model iphone 3gs
 built in camera 3megapixels, can record video
 Cheers
 Heh, finally
 Proper bt support announced?
 iphone 3gs starts at $199 for 16gb
 BitTorrent? ;)
 not built in
 Yep BitTorrent Alex... BitTorrent 
 but theres a peer to peer support
 I meant bluetooth :-p
 Or it could also be BT the carrier ;)
 So basically, that was a very poor choice of acronym ;)
 yes thats supported bread, the iphone 3g starts at $99 8gb
 US prices aren't interesting to us :p
 With OBEX file transfer support though? I was under the impression it was just headsets
 alex I'm guessing its cheaper in the uk? no?
 there's also voice control built in
 Well, if you get a more expensive contract, yes
 Or more expensive if you get a less expensive contract

 god ill stop spamming now Ã­'m anoyying myself!
 Andrew: Server being slow for you?
 Like cPanel ?
 ftp
 hold on Brandon
 not bad for me
 @o down crownz.info
 Umm, apache being great brandon. Haven't been on cPanel or FTP yet, but I'll check
 It's up.
 but there again the servers like in my back yard
 Brandon: is that the server you're letting me use?
 crownz.info is up
 Pie`: yes
 FTP is perfect for me
 because about 10 minutes ago it wouldn't let me on my domain
 but it works now
 '<pyDelphi>It's up."
 I was asking if cPanel was slow not if its up or down xD
 o
 can't help you there
 cpanel only took 3 seconds to load, maybe less
 hmm
 yeah its was pretty snappy
 would be less but I loaded it from crownz.info:2082
 so none of the iamges were caches
 cached
 and my internet is slow, so for it to load that quick is good
 I have a question, is anyone here... sorry about my english I'm from Argentina
 move to #hosting please
 ask there
 ok, thanks
 "Your website at http://uuuq.com is back up.  The internet thanks you!"
 Where's that?
 Ah, uuuq.com is resolving
 but to a server page
 it's not your site
 yes, I only have email updates for uuuq.com
 figured if it goes down then mysite will too
 Not true in this case unfortunately
 what do you mean? my sites are redirected to that page as well
 no, you're asubdomains
 the subdomains are not up, therefore you site is not up
 Ah, yes, sorry
 You're right
 still, it's not YOUR site :p
 lol yes I know, not my fault they think it is

 I am not a twat!
 He didn't say all Americans were twats
 full of
 I'm not a twat
 Adam is a twat
 :p
 Adam likes twat*
 Meaning there are some who are not
 Frank needs to be careful who he calls a twat
 Adam> And everyone knows America is full of a bunch of twats.
 Frank. I did not mean it personally. Unlike your comment at calling me a twat.
 :p
 I'm off, back later

 Apology accepted.

 Dskaattinen*
 :O
 No, he's very generous
 He's just offered you cake
 strawberry cake
 No..
 Yikes, and coming from Brandon as well :p
 Yea ;-)
 I think the reason is too much time and general boreness
 getting a life would be a good solution
 Wait, instead of mentally challenged lets try fat because he seems very obsesive of food. Which means you can't say 'Yikes, and coming from Brandon as well :p' Alex :p
 But too late now =[
 no, I don't have any fetishes of food 
 :o
 Why not?
 you don't like any cakes, right?
 Only chocolate cake.
 Well, any cake tbh.
 Well, you could also go nuts if you have to use Win98
 I WANT CAKE!!!!! 
 I'm just a victim of it :(
 You're a victim of cake?
 Did the cake run away when you tried to nom nom nom?
 I'm victim of win98
 Really?  Now?

 hey andrew ive got a ? for you
 well, i would start to talk about pancakes again
 because anyone isn't alive here
 or really anyone is there a way to make an image hidden?
 what do you mean
 remove the image from the html code
 then its hidden
 i need to have an image on the webpage so that it goes into this scroll box but to put it on the scroll box it has to be in the post...
 well I know how to solve your problem
 1. go to the kitchen
 2. open your fridge
 3. take some pancakes
 4. send them to Brandon
 5. your problem is solved :)
 wtf..
 outlet|work: eh?
 I don't understand what you're wanting
 yeah me neither
 You want an image to be in a certain place, so why not just put the image there?
 My nose needs a good picking.
 Full to the brim with dirt.
 because the slider takes the iamge from the post
 The "slider"
 Can you give me an actual example of what you mean :p
 yeah like an image slider
 One like on www.brandonmcdonald.co.uk ?
 did you send those pancakes to Brandon?
 I've never understood that by the way, Brandon
 It doesn't seem like those should be the only two options :p
 Alex: Nor me :p
 I come away vaguely miffed by the whole affair ;)
 Yea, I was thinking that. Plus it shouldn't even be "Stranger or Devil" it's just ermm like the same thing hah
 Who's website is that?
 And no one wasy Brandon Mcdonalds
 are you Brandon madonald?
 Yes :-P
 Did you make that site?
 do you have pancakeas
 Yes? Well, Ruben made the slider for me :)
 I just did the images etc..
 Well, that's all it is 3 images haha
 you're weird
 Cheers :-P
 hmm I would go and take some sima

 How's the weather outside today? :)
 is he beggin for food again all the time alex?
 Wet
 I like this website
 http://www.thecreativedistrict.ie/
 Unlucky, Alex :p
 Me too
 Well, warm here 
 Not so surprising, for the north east of England :p
 what the.. I dont live in england :D
 No, I do
 I wish I was in a creative mood
 For a bit over half the year :p
 I prefer the winter
 The air conditioning was pumping out heat rather than lovely cool air not good tbh
 At workies.
 you wish a lot huh adam? :P
 Yes
 People here knew what I meant ;).  North England is definitely /not/ known for being warm :p
 Well, finland has something like hot summer and cold winter
 Continental weather
 Whereas we have maritime
 I hear people from finland sleep with their siblings?
 (yeah, I still remember some GCSE geography, go me ;))
 Adam, don't think so
 But I heard it
 we sleep alone
 Are you saying what I heard was a lie? :o
 yes he did :O
 probably yes if i really know what you mean
 Oh. Okay...
 Sorry for the confusion, must be some other country...
 eurovision \,,/
 finland's so good in it .D
 No
 Ireland have the most wins actually
 Agreed
 you don't sense any sarcasm? :D
 or irony? :D
 No sense no feeling
 You have won :p
 finland has just one win
 Which is better than some
 well, last time it was again zero points, what a surpris
 e
 well, I think the song from Norway was good
 i'm ashamed of my country, every year AGAIN big shame really T_T
 they should stay out of eurovision, serieusly
 where are u from
 you dun wanna know
 tell me, or i will start talking about pancakes
 From what I can see, there are something like 26 countries that have never won
 And most of those have never made it to the top 5
 So... finland aren't that bad :p
 XD
 well, finland made a world record of points but norway broke that :(
 UK has had the most top 5 finishes :p
 If only it actually meant something to do well at Eurovision
 but I think waldo's people wasn't bad if you compare it with some song from 80's
 only thing i like in summer is that you can't say it's night if you look out the window
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JSPh286spM how about that one?  That got us 0 points ;)
 They just aren't in tune through the whole thing :p

 ooh what was wrong with it?
 it wouldn't upload images
 it would only give you a space to type a url to an image
 Oh, the c ause?
 Because TinyMCE creators are greedy and wanted me to pay $40 for that funtionality
 So I found a tinymce plugin that did similar, and screwed around with that for 2 hours last night
 Ahah
 Bread
 Adam
 I bet you'd drive a slammed lexus if you could drive

 kick it tim!!
 w00t
 iPhone SDK 3.0 final is downloaded
 hm thats odd
 music played on windows is much poorer quality that ti is when played on ubuntu
 even though its the same song
 I find the opposite is true
 On windows its all dulled down and noisy
 but it's ebcause of my 5.1 surround sound setup that ubuntu doesn't take advantage of properly
 on ubuntu its crystal clear
 Pie` has to do with sound drivers, speakers, song quaility... a lot more than just 1 thing
 Probably your media player

 Bread Frank is back from jail!
 :|
 I'm so tired of that crap
 Yeah, he got back a day or so Andrew 
 I didn't even know.
 He said he went to help is grandparents :/
 frank is the food any good?
 bread I thought you were "showering" 
 You guys better shutup because I was never in prison - I'm so tired of this crap
 See, protesting it again, a true sign that he was...
 OMG
 I was Andrew, I finished :P
 Your a quick one aren't you
 Frank I imagine doesn't shower.
 10 mins?
 Yeah Bread, thats why my hair is a bit damp right now, I just got out of the shower
 They don't bring back harrowing memories Frank?
 rofl
 Bread, you better knock it off right now, I'm tired of this crap
 Just admit you went to prison then!
 I'm gonna start a rumor about you
 !k Bread stop bullying
 Sorry Adam, but we need to make him aware that to rehabilitate he must admit to him and his peers that he has done wrong.
 The first step is admiting.
 Bread you better stop I was never in prison. I'm tired of the crap you are saying about me
 Bread :( stop it
 if that's the story you want to stick to, so be it, but I along with most of the people in here know the truth. I'll drop it, but be it on your conscience...
 tututu, I cant leave a minute or prison break is on here? :O
 Frank why does it bug you so much that bread says you were in prison?
 nothing wrong with prison
 i was in prison on fathersday frank
 @Andrew, because I wasnt actually in prison
 And because I wasnt in prison - I dont enjoy bread saying that stuff
 jealous adam

 I've been sorting out my camping gear and well, I had the radios on charge and I've been playing with one and I pick up something and I've been walking around the whole house to get a perfect signal but then.. seems to be my damn TFT that is causing it to freak out :(
 Weird

 is there a library for getting game info for cs:S servers and stuff like that

 hi guys, who i can talk to regarding phpAdmin issue?
 ???
 In #hosting you may Chade 
 Did you come via http://livechat.zymic.com?
 well i actually came through the official zymic website
 and i have a lil issue with my db
 Where on the main page did you find the mibbit link please?
 http://www.zymic.com/forum/ 
 top right corner 
 Chat in real time at irc.zymic.com this one?
 yeah ;)
 That links to livechat.zymic.com, or does it link to mibbit?
 Livechat here
 livechat here as well
 I don't mean to be rude, but why did you join general chat?
 We don't mind having you, we're just trying to streamline it and we need to find out why people are still joining here.
 When they have hosting questions
 well, i have been searching the forums for the last one and a half hrs, and this was my final resort
 Sorry, what I meant was why you clicked 'General chat' over 'Hosting chat'
 Don't worry, you're not the only one to do it
 well, it is my 1st time around this site, but i apologize for it :)
 nxt time i'll know
 Sorry, I'm not intending to flame, I'm just trying see if we can improve the way it is presented.
 i know man ;) i'm an IT Engineer myself and i know how those things work ;) user feedback!!! :P
 so dont worry at all ;) no offence taken ;)
 ooo murray is losing.
 hes poo
 Bad start in this first set
 dyeah
 He's held serve in the second one so far
 yay, a wild Tim appears :D
 :)
 Federa > Murry > Nadal :O
 Federer, Murray*
 watching paint dry > teniss
 lol
 IM OFF TO THE SHOPS
 There are much more boring sports than tennis
 Golf, Cricket
 I like the olympics :)
 Grand Prix isn't that exhilarating unless there's a crash
 Watch rally instead then :p
 Yeah, I like WRC
 Quite good for crashes
 Or car failure due to a bad knock
 I love how they jump out the car and just bash the car a log to fix it, then just drive on
 *lot
 They're being timed!  Can't go and fetch tools :p
 And they will continue even if they can't fix it
 So they'll carry on with a completely broken suspension or something :p
 Lies
 A slow time is preferable to not finishing usually
 Indeed, but it's still quite amusing to see them smacking their cars with an uprooted log
 that was beautiful
 Mr Stanly Fred wants to send me 30 million pounds!
 :o
 anyone here good at converting pages to a cms?
 he's on a roll now.
 who bread? he's a roll now
 /changenick Bread Roll
 nope :P murray.

 ok so i use alt to do that, i see
 Oh! That's how I was doing it :-P .. Was confused every time I had done it.

 now that is one classy lady
 Mark2, 
 She's so classy! She should teach at a Finishing School!
 - Shanna, Florida, USA, 29/6/2009 14:06
 Not from florida
 Unless originally from UK
 Nobody here says finishing school
 Unless they're talking about some small women's colleges mostly on the east coast
 It's mostly a swiss thing apparently, I've never heard it in real life
 lol
 Her nose O_o
 her bewbs
 G
 Fake
 ^
 her face is fake too
 Theyve been slated, but I love them, she said. 
 I had them done about six times over a year.
 Ive also had Botox on my forehead and around my eyes, and fillers in my nose-to-mouth laughter lines. 
 'I cant imagine not having Botox  its the best thing ever. My face looks better now than when I was 23.
 Explore more:
 Looks like it
 If that's her face at it's best I would hate to have seen her at her worst, frightful!
 - SW, Newcastle, 29/6/2009 14:10
 lol
 :)
 Very true, but I would point out, by reading a news article about her, you're sort of vindicating her opinion that she matters
 lol
 now I feel unclean
 ?
 did you wet your pants or something?
 Think I've just come up with the headline if Murray wins
 "It's a Murraycle!"
 lol
 That's awful, Bread, awful :p
 So yeah, perfect tabloid stuff
 Beat me to it ;)
 That is if they have room for Murray
 It might be another day of MJ in the tabloids
 The quality papers have moved on which is nice :p
 Oh dear
 They really are appalling stories as well
 A friend buys the mirror in my house, and I saw some of that on the day after it happened
 You need to disown them
 It was just page after page of random speculation, sensationalist commentary, and huge pictures
 The thing is, there's 10 people in the house :p
 I buy the Independent most days, and it gets read by about three people :p
 The Mirror gets read by about 6
 And this is a university
 Something is wrong with the world :p
 :P
 Could be worse of course
 It's not the Star, the Sun or the News of the World
 hmm.. client crashed
 All just as bad as each other :P
 Your fault Mark2, YOUR FAULT.
 Not really, the Mirror is just stupid :p
 The rest are even more shallow, and I know that may be an unimportant distinction given the scale
 But well, at least I have managed to stop the person who buys the Mirror from calling it a paper :p
 He now leaves saying he's going to buy his magazine
 there are more advertisments in that than actual articles
 I don't think what it has can be accused of being articles
 yawn
 I tried to think of a better word
 Drivel :p
 columns of shit?
 better
 I want to see that Dinosaur stage production
 Not heard anything about that
 But I'm not necessarily likely to :p
 If I've gone to someplace like that, it's usually to see stand-up, not a show
 pretty impressive what they can pull off
 I got asked if I wanted to see that, but faced with having Â£50 or seeing it, I chose the Â£50
 last one I saw was the stage production of Lord of the Rings, the stuff they managed to do was incredible
 Hah
 "Both players off to point Percy at the porcelain, and the fans keep themselves entertained with a rather weak Mexican Wave. Ian Hislop, for one, is not playing ball."
 This commentary is so weird at times
 5live?
 BBC live text
 Can't be bothered with the radio
 And I'm not allowed to watch the TV feed live :p
 Heh, so you can't go to http://www.tvcatchup.com?
 Any live TV, you need a TV license
 By law
 Otherwise I'd watch it on iPlayer ;P
 Should just use Jack's vpn :P
 Then again, that won't be in the UK
 So it won't work :p
 you don't need a TV license for iPlayer do you?
 You don't need it to watch on-demand stuff
 You do need it to watch live stuff
 ah I see
 how is that regulated?
 The TV licensing authority
 Basically the BBC's private police :p
 That assumes you're guilty until you pay them money
 how do they know you're watching live stuff on iPlayer without a TV license though? I know about a normal TV but...
 IM MAKING MORE COCKTAILS ANDREW
 Want one?
 Sure
 PLEASE Tim
 I need one, shit
 you're too young DarkKrai
 D:

 Sounds good, never had pernod

 Bought this bottle in Paris
 little alcohole shop place in Montmarte
 They might not check, Mark2
